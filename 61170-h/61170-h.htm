<h3 class="tdc">PREFACE.</h3>

<p>The nature and duties of the pastoral office form a
subject of great practical moment. The thoughts suggested
in this volume are largely results of the writer&rsquo;s
personal experience in the ministry and of his observation
of pastoral work in our churches. The literature
of the subject, however, has of late become specially
rich and valuable, and the hints which a careful study
of this furnishes have also been freely used. The experienced
pastor, for whom some of these suggestions will
be needless, will remember that they were originally
embodied in lectures delivered to the classes in the
Hamilton Theological Seminary, and prepared for young
men who, for the most part, were as yet inexperienced
in the pastoral care.</p>

<p>With the earnest prayer and hope that the work may
receive the approval of the Master and may contribute
in some humble measure, to the higher effectiveness of
the Gospel ministry, it is now submitted to the Christian
public.</p>

<h3 id="s1" class="tdc">SECTION I.</h3>

<p class="tdc">THE DIVINE CALL TO THE MINISTRY.</p>

<p>A special call from God is essential to the exercise of
the Christian ministry. Reason itself would suggest that
He, as a sovereign, would select His own officers and send
His own ambassadors; and the Divine call of the ancient
prophets, the analogous office in the old dispensation,
creates a presumption of such a call in the Christian
ministry. None were permitted to intrude into the prophetic
office. God said: &ldquo;The prophet which shall presume
to speak a work in My name, which I have not
commanded him to speak, shall die&rdquo; (Deut. xviii.&nbsp;20);
&ldquo;Behold, I am against the prophets that steal My words&rdquo;
(Jer. xxiii.&nbsp;30; see also Isa. vi.; Jer. i.&nbsp;4&ndash;10). The proof of
this is seen in the following considerations: 1.&nbsp;Ministers,
in the New Testament, are always spoken of as designated
by God. This is obviously true of the apostles and of
the seventy, but it is seen also in the case of the ministry
in general. The elders of Ephesus were set over the
flock by the Holy Ghost (Acts xx.&nbsp;28). Archippus received
his ministry &ldquo;in the Lord&rdquo; (Col. iv.&nbsp;17). Paul
and Barnabas were separated to their work by the Holy
<span class="pagenum" id="p14">[p.&nbsp;14]</span>
Ghost (Acts xiii.&nbsp;2). 2.&nbsp;The ministry constitute a special
gift from Christ to the church; for &ldquo;He gave some,
Apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists;
and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the
saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of
the body of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. iv.&nbsp;11, 12). The gifts for these
offices are bestowed by God, and the men are sent forth
to their work by God Himself, in answer to the prayers
of His people. (See Rom. xii.&nbsp;6, 7; Luke x.&nbsp;1, 2.) 3.&nbsp;The
nature of the office, as implied in the terms used to designate
it, requires a personal Divine call. They are called
&ldquo;ambassadors for Christ,&rdquo; speaking in His name; they are
&ldquo;stewards of God,&rdquo; entrusted with the Gospel for men.</p>

<p>The ministry, then, is not chosen as a man chooses a
profession, consulting his inclination or interest. It is
entered in obedience to a special call from God, and the
consciousness of this is essential to personal qualification
for the work. The emphasis which the Scriptures place
on the Divine vocation of the minister implies a distinction
between a call to the ministry and the ordinary
choice of a profession. This distinction, in one important
element at least, may perhaps be thus expressed:
In the case of the minister the work is one to which the
conscience <i>obliges;</i> he feels that he <i>ought</i> to engage in it,
and that he cannot do otherwise without <i>guilt.</i> But in
the case of one choosing another profession it is a matter
of aptitudes, tastes, interest; he feels that it is <i>right</i> and
<i>wise</i> thus to choose, but there is no sense of imperative
<i>obligation,</i> so that it would be morally <i>wrong</i> to do otherwise.
In the one, there is the sense of positive obligation
as expressed in its strongest form by Paul: &ldquo;Necessity
is laid upon me; yea, woe is unto me, if I preach
not the Gospel&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. ix.&nbsp;16); in the other, there is a
sense of the rightfulness of the choice made and a consciousness
<span class="pagenum" id="p15">[p.&nbsp;15]</span>
of the Divine approbation in making it, but the
contrary choice would not necessarily be morally wrong.</p>

<p>As to the manifestation of this call, two opposite errors
are to be avoided. On the one hand, the call is conceived
as consisting in a mere preference for the work of the
ministry, and the result is that men influenced only by
literary tastes or unhallowed ambition rush unbidden
into the sacred office. On the other, it is regarded as
a supernatural manifestation, like a voice from heaven,
attended with intense mental struggles; and, as the result,
men who ought to enter the ministry are, in the absence
of such manifestations, deterred from entering it and mistake
their true mission in life. Evidently, this duty is to
be ascertained in the same manner as any other duty.
The call, indeed, is a Divine act, but so also is regeneration;
yet in neither case is the manifestation necessarily
or ordinarily supernatural. The evidences of it are found
in a prayerful examination of one&rsquo;s own experience compared
with God&rsquo;s Word. Christian young men, therefore,
should be urged to ponder carefully the question whether
God is not calling them to the ministry. A pastor&rsquo;s utmost
wisdom and discrimination should be employed in inspiring
and guiding young men to right thinking in regard
to their life-mission. Many a life-failure might thus be
prevented, and many a noble man whose life otherwise
had been devoted to secular pursuits would be saved for
effective service in the pulpit. This call, I conceive, is
manifested in the heart of the individual, in the convictions
of the church, and in the providence of God.</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">The Internal Call.</span>&mdash;The elements of this are: 1.&nbsp;<i>A
fixed and earnest desire for the work.</i> &ldquo;This is a true saying,
if a man desire the office of a bishop, he desireth a
good work&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim. iii.&nbsp;1). There must be desire; for no
man will succeed unless the work enlists the whole enthusiasm
<span class="pagenum" id="p16">[p.&nbsp;16]</span>
of his being. This is more than a love of declamation,
a glow in the work of composition, or a taste for
the studious, literary life of a pastor: it is a quenchless
enthusiasm for the work as the proclamation of God&rsquo;s message
and the means of saving men. It springs from love
to Christ and love to the work itself. Paul said: &ldquo;None
of these things move me, neither count I my life dear
unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy,
and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus,
to testify the Gospel of the grace of God&rdquo; (Acts xx.&nbsp;24).
2.&nbsp;<i>An abiding impression of duty to preach the Gospel.</i> The
apostle Paul said: &ldquo;Necessity is laid upon me; yea, woe is
unto me, if I preach not the Gospel&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. ix.&nbsp;16). Not
always, indeed, will this inward impulsion to the work be
so distinct and imperative, but it will always be felt, and
with greatest force as the soul draws nearest to God and
the true nature of the ministry is most clearly perceived.
Hence, in determining the question of vocation much
prayer is necessary, and the convictions which predominate
in the soul, when most consciously in God&rsquo;s presence,
are to be most carefully considered. 3.&nbsp;<i>A sense of personal
weakness and unworthiness and a heartfelt reliance
on Divine power.</i> This, indeed, is not an infallible test,
for youth is naturally self-confident, and in the case of
some most useful ministers a reliance alone on the Divine
Arm has come only after long and bitter experience of self-failure.
But a self-confident spirit should certainly suggest
the fear of self-deception, since it can only spring
from a false self-estimate and from wholly inadequate
views of the work. Paul said: &ldquo;Such trust have we
through Christ to God-ward; not that we are sufficient of
ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God, who also hath
made us able ministers of the New Testament&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor.
iii.&nbsp;4&ndash;6).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p17">[p.&nbsp;17]</span>
II. <span class="smcap">The Call of the Church.</span>&mdash;This is the expressed
conviction of the church, after sufficient acquaintance with
the candidate, that he is called to preach the Gospel&mdash;a
conviction resulting from evidences of his qualifications,
such as the following: 1.&nbsp;<i>Sound conversion.</i> This qualification
is vital and central. A defect here is fatal&mdash;fatal to
the minister himself as almost certain to result in his living
and dying unconverted, and fatal to the people as
placing their souls under the guidance of a spiritually-blind,
godless pastor. Few positions have in them so
many elements of danger as that of an unconverted pastor,
since, though officially laboring for the conversion of
others, his very office places him beyond the scope of all
the ordinary means employed by the churches to lead
men to Christ and furnishes the strongest incentives to
yield to self-deception. No man should enter it of whose
conversion the church with which he is connected has
doubt; regard alike for the soul of the candidate and for
the souls of men demands that in respect to this primary
qualification the case should be absolutely clear so far as
man may judge. 2.&nbsp;<i>A superior order of piety.</i> He is to be
&ldquo;an example of the believers in word, in conversation, in
charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim. iv.&nbsp;12). He
must needs be, in some respects, a model, and must therefore
be in advance of the people in experience and life.
No brilliancy of intellectual or literary or rhetorical qualification
can atone for the absence of a devotional spirit and
a pure life in a Christian pastor. 3.&nbsp;<i>Soundness in the faith.</i>
He is both to &ldquo;hold fast the form of sound words&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim.
i.&nbsp;13) and to &ldquo;speak the things which become sound doctrine&rdquo;
(Tit. ii.&nbsp;1). A man who is unsettled in his convictions
of religious truth, or who palters to the love of novelty
by a perpetual straining for that which is strange and
startling in doctrine has no rightful place in the pulpit,
<span class="pagenum" id="p18">[p.&nbsp;18]</span>
however popular his address or large his following. The
ultimate result of his work is almost always disastrous to
the cause of truth. 4.&nbsp;<i>Adequate mental capacity and training,
and scriptural knowledge.</i> He is to show himself &ldquo;approved
unto God, a workman that needeth not to be
ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;15).
As the chief work of a minister is public instruction,
it is plain he must possess the mental force and knowledge
requisite to make his ministry instructive. Moral and spiritual
qualifications cannot be made a substitute for intellectual,
for the preacher&rsquo;s work is to unfold and enforce
truth in the pulpit as well as to illustrate it in holy living.
Piety, therefore, essential as it is, if not accompanied with
mental gifts and discipline, is not evidence of a ministerial
call. Some good men have made a life-mistake by taking
on them the responsibilities of public instructors when
deficient either in natural abilities or in the discipline
and knowledge which are essential to meet the continuous
and exhaustive draft of the pulpit. 5.&nbsp;<i>Aptness to teach.</i>
God&rsquo;s Word is to be committed only &ldquo;to faithful men, who
shall be able to teach others also&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;2)&mdash;men &ldquo;apt
to teach, patient, in meekness instructing those that oppose
themselves&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;24, 25). Great abilities and learning
do not suffice; there must also be the special gift of
teaching, the power to gather and interest and hold the
people. The ablest sermon fails unless the people are
awake and attentive. Paul and Barnabas not only preached
the Gospel, but they &ldquo;<i>so</i> spake that a great multitude, both
of the Jews and also of the Greeks, believed&rdquo; (Acts xiv.&nbsp;1).
6.&nbsp;<i>Practical wisdom and executive ability.</i> Nowhere are these
qualities more important than in a pastor, whose good
sense, tact, judgment, power to organize and set at work
all the moral forces of his church, are in constant requisition.
A large part of the pastor&rsquo;s power depends on the
<span class="pagenum" id="p19">[p.&nbsp;19]</span>
possession of certain practical qualities; in the absence of
these, men of great mental abilities and spiritual worth
have failed in the pastorate. 7.&nbsp;<i>Finally, a good report of
them which are without.</i> A minister cannot escape opposition.
If faithful to Christ, he may experience, as thousands
have experienced, bitter persecution; but in purity and
integrity of personal character he is to &ldquo;have a good
report&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim. iii.&nbsp;7), &ldquo;giving none offence, that the ministry
be not blamed&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. vi.&nbsp;3), but &ldquo;commending&rdquo;
himself &ldquo;to every man&rsquo;s conscience in the sight of God&rdquo;
(2&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;2). Without this acknowledged purity of spirit
and life, his work as a minister is necessarily a failure, for
otherwise he cannot keep the consciences of men on his
side.</p>

<p>Now, the call of the church is founded on evidence in
the candidate of these qualifications, either in their germ
and promise where the character is immature, or in their
fully-developed form where age and experience have
matured the man. This conviction in the mind of the
church is ordinarily an essential evidence of a Divine
call; for plainly, since the individual himself is not the
proper judge as to his possession of these qualifications,
the church is the natural medium of the call, and its
decision ought ordinarily to be accepted as final.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">The Call of Providence.</span>&mdash;Circumstances may
absolutely forbid entering the ministry, but it is obvious
that all difficulties are not to be interpreted adversely to
a call, for such obstacles may be, and often are, simply a
discipline educative and preparatory to the highest success
in the sacred office. The strength and symmetry
of character which have afterward given eminence in the
ministry have often been acquired by means of the struggles
encountered in the preparation to enter it. But God
has distinctly promised direction to those who ask Him:
<span class="pagenum" id="p20">[p.&nbsp;20]</span>
&ldquo;The steps of a good man are ordered by the Lord&rdquo; (Ps.
xxxvii.&nbsp;23); &ldquo;If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask
of God, that giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth
not, and <i>it shall be given him</i>&rdquo; (James i.&nbsp;5). To the man
of prayer, the call of Providence comes in the events of
his life, which, as interpreted by the Spirit&rsquo;s guidance, are
finger-boards at every turn, saying, &ldquo;This is the way, walk
ye in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>No man ought to enter the sacred work without this
distinct consciousness of a call from God. For, 1.&nbsp;<i>Without
this he obtrudes himself into the office of an ambassador
without a commission, and incurs the guilt of presumption.</i>
God has not sent him and has given him no
message, and as he stands up to speak in God&rsquo;s name
not one of all the promises of God to His accredited servants
belongs to him, but he is exposed to all the threatenings
against those who speak without command.
2.&nbsp;<i>Without this also he cannot speak consciously, as an &ldquo;ambassador
for Christ,&rdquo; &ldquo;in Christ&rsquo;s stead&rdquo;</i> (2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;20),
<i>and he of necessity lacks the courage and boldness of him
who is conscious of bearing a Divine message.</i> True ministerial
boldness in the pulpit depends on this consciousness
of being God&rsquo;s servant, bearing God&rsquo;s message;
in the absence of this he cannot speak with authority.
3.&nbsp;<i>Nothing but this consciousness of a Divine call is
adequate to inspire for the toils of the pastor&rsquo;s office and
sustain in its trials.</i> Disappointments and discouragements
come, in which he must fall back for support and
comfort on the great primary fact that he is God&rsquo;s servant,
specially called to that office and that work; and if
this fail him, all the true sources of courage and strength
are wanting, and his condition is pitiable indeed. Therefore,
as Luther says: &ldquo;Every minister of God&rsquo;s Word
should be sure of his calling, that before God and man
<span class="pagenum" id="p21">[p.&nbsp;21]</span>
he may with a bold conscience glory therein, that he
preached the Gospel as one that is sent; even as the ambassador
of a king glorieth and vaunteth in this, that he
cometh not as a private person, but as the king&rsquo;s
<span class="wsnw">ambassador.&rdquo;<a id="s1_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#s1_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<h3 id="s2" class="tdc">SECTION II.</h3>

<p class="tdc">SETTLEMENT IN THE MINISTRY.</p>

<p class="tdc">I. <span class="smcap">Choice of a Field.</span></p>

<p>The choice of a field, especially of the first field, is a
matter of much moment, as it is sometimes decisive in its
influence on subsequent development and usefulness. A
young man, however, should beware of undue anxiety
respecting it. A Divine call involves not only an appointed
work, but also an appointed field of work. The subject
should be made, therefore, a special matter of prayer, and
the opportunities Providence may open for making the
acquaintance of churches should be faithfully improved.
The Lord will then direct by the leading alike of His
Spirit and the heart and of His providence in external
events. Several suggestions, however, may here be important:</p>

<p>1. <i>Carefully consider the question whether duty does not
call to a missionary field.</i> No one should evade a full, fair
consideration of this, for success and comfort in one&rsquo;s
life-work depend, not on obtaining what is termed an eligible
settlement, but on occupying the post God has assigned
us. All parts of the world are now opening to the
Gospel, and in our own country vast populations are gathering
from other lands, sent hither to be evangelized. Evidently,
<span class="pagenum" id="p22">[p.&nbsp;22]</span>
many of the young men now called to the ministry
must be designed by the Master for work among the destitute.
Eminence among ministerial brethren is a proper
object of ambition, but it is a mistake to suppose that the
choice of a mission-field, either East or West, will prevent
this. A much larger proportion of our foreign missionaries
rise to eminence in their work than of ministers at
home. The men who are recognized as Christian leaders
in the West are mostly men who went there to struggle
with the difficulties of a new country and a small salary.
By roughing it at the outset they developed manhood
and power. Some of the ablest and most eloquent men
of this age developed in pulpit power at the West. It
is true in the ministry, as everywhere, that he who for
Christ&rsquo;s sake will lose his life shall save it. A sacrifice
and a struggle for Christ in earlier life give development
and momentum to all the elements of power in a man.
There is here wide room for a venturesome faith; and
nothing is more certain than that many, by seeking at
once great things for themselves, dwarf their after-life.</p>

<p>2. <i>If different fields offer, that is ordinarily to be preferred
which affords the highest incentives to exertion and
the widest room for expansion.</i> Few things are more chilling
to a young man than to find his church hemmed in,
with no possibilities of future growth. This is often the
fact in old and decaying communities overcrowded with
churches. Seek, therefore, not so much an old church or
a large salary as a center where population is gathering, so
that the field will grow with your growth. This was the
Apostles&rsquo; plan. They went where the people were, and
gave their lives to the work where the largest numbers
could be reached. Still, duty may call to a field where
these elements do not exist. In that case, do not fear. A
man&rsquo;s gift, faithfully used, will make room for him. In
<span class="pagenum" id="p23">[p.&nbsp;23]</span>
any field it will take time to grow so as to fill it, and the
experience will be valuable; and when one has grown to the
full measure of his field, and is still advancing in power,
other and wider fields will be sure to open before him.</p>

<p>3. <i>The call should ordinarily be unanimous, at least so
far as to ensure that no important influences are opposed
to it.</i> On this account sufficient time, if possible, should
be spent with the church to study carefully the elements
of which it is composed and form an intelligent judgment
of its characteristics and tendencies. Many mistakes
might be avoided by care to secure a thorough acquaintance
between the candidate and the people before
a call is accepted&mdash;mistakes which are sometimes most
unfortunate alike to the minister, in rendering his pastorate
a failure and embarrassing him in forming another
relation; and to the church, in hindering their union and
weakening their effectiveness.</p>

<p class="tnoteil">TRANSCRIBER&rsquo;S NOTE: This next point
includes the word &ldquo;niggardly,&rdquo; which is a fine word,
meaning &ldquo;stingy,&rdquo; &ldquo;grasping,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;miserly,&rdquo; but, to those who are unfamiliar with
the word or who are not paying strict attention, it can sound like
a racial slur. When presenting this material, please strongly
consider the substitution of a synonym.</p>

<p>4. <i>The salary should be adequate for a comfortable support,
and should be fairly proportioned to the pecuniary
ability of the congregation.</i> The minister will be expected
to live in a manner at least equal to the average style of
life among the people, and the salary should enable him
to do so. A &ldquo;donation,&rdquo; as a part of the payment of
ministerial service, is to be avoided if possible. It is
perhaps a necessity in some localities from long-established
custom; but it is essentially unjust to the minister,
because it calls that a gift which is really a debt, and its
effect is to foster in the people false ideas of ministerial
support. The New Testament declares that &ldquo;the laborer
is worthy of his hire&rdquo; (Luke x.&nbsp;7), and it is injurious
alike to the self-respect of the pastor and to the respect of
the people for his office to make his support a matter of
gratuity. It is better, in my judgment, to accept a smaller
salary, the payments of which are fixed and regular, than
<span class="pagenum" id="p24">[p.&nbsp;24]</span>
to insist on a larger one, a part of which comes in the
uncertain form of a &ldquo;donation.&rdquo; In the matter of salary,
however, a true pastor will always tenderly regard the circumstances
of his people; and in a congregation composed
chiefly of the poor, or in times of financial depression and
disaster, he will be ready to suffer with them, cheerfully
accepting a smaller stipend and practicing a more rigid
economy. A selfish, niggardly, parsimonious spirit is nowhere
more offensive than in a Christian pastor.</p>

<p>5. <i>All business arrangements with a church should be
made with business definiteness.</i> It may not, indeed, be
necessary or desirable to insist upon a formal written contract,
but it would save many a painful misunderstanding
if the chief features in the agreement were always in
writing. Properly, the call of the church should specifically
state the chief points agreed on; but, whether this
is done or not, the letter of acceptance should specify them
distinctly. The points to be thus specified are: the time
at which the pastor will enter on his work, the amount
of salary and the times of payment, and the vacation to be
allowed. This should ordinarily not be less than four
weeks and should be understood as fully releasing the
pastor during that time from all responsibility for the
pulpit and from all pastoral service.</p>

<p>6. <i>The minister, in all his relations with a church, should
exhibit a delicate sense of honor.</i> He may not encourage
a call when there is no serious probability of its
acceptance. A church call and its declination may
gratify a man&rsquo;s vanity and give him a temporary publicity,
but such ministerial coquetry is destitute of
Christian honor, and in the end reacts disastrously on
him who practices it. It is no light thing thus to trifle
with a church of the Lord Jesus Christ, and to dishonor
the ministerial office before the world.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p25">[p.&nbsp;25]</span>
II. <span class="smcap">Obligations assumed in becoming a Pastor.</span></p>

<p>In accepting a call to the pastorate of a church, the
following things are understood: 1.&nbsp;That the pastor
accepts as scriptural the doctrine and practice of that
church, and places himself under obligation to teach
and defend them; for this is obviously a chief duty in
the office of a pastor. If his convictions do not permit
him to uphold the doctrine and practice of the church, he
is untrue to himself and to it in accepting the office.
And if, while occupying the pastorate, his views of doctrine
and practice undergo a change, he is, indeed, entitled
to full freedom of personal conviction and action,
but he is under obligation to resign his office; for an
essential condition on which it was conferred on him has
ceased to exist, and every consideration of honor requires
him to withdraw from it. It is difficult to conceive a
more dishonorable position than that of a pastor who, after
having accepted the sacred office of teacher and defender
of the doctrine and practice of the Gospel, as understood by
the church, and having subsequently undergone a change
in his own convictions, shall still retain that office only
to subvert the doctrines he had placed himself under
solemn obligation to defend. 2.&nbsp;It is understood, also,
that he accepts the care of the souls of that congregation
as a sacred trust from Christ, to devote himself without
reserve in labor and prayer for their salvation. The one
great work of his life, to which all the faculties of his
being are to be consecrated, is the salvation of those
souls and the edification and perfection of that church.
If he accepts the office for its emoluments, for the literary
position it gives him, or the stepping-stone to some
other position; or if he shall, while pastor, allow himself
to become absorbed in other interests, so as to divert his
<span class="pagenum" id="p26">[p.&nbsp;26]</span>
chief energies from this sacred trust in the care of these
souls, he is false to the pledge involved in assuming the
pastorate, and is guilty of a dishonorable act. 3.&nbsp;It is
further understood that he will maintain his post amidst
the adversity as well as the prosperity of the church, as
the shepherd to whom Christ has entrusted the care of
that flock. Our Lord makes fidelity to the flock in
danger the test of a good shepherd: &ldquo;The good shepherd
giveth his life for the sheep. But he that is a hireling,
whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and
leaveth the sheep and fleeth; and the wolf catcheth them,
and scattereth the sheep&rdquo; (John x.&nbsp;11, 12). The trials
which may meet a church, so far from justifying the
pastor in leaving it, may be only an additional evidence
of his duty to remain. He may not abandon, in a time
of perplexity and danger, the flock the Lord committed
to him.</p>

<p class="cgap">III. <span class="smcap">Ordination.</span></p>

<p>Church officers, according to New Testament usage, are
chosen from members of the church. No church, therefore,
can properly call a Council to ordain until the person
to be ordained is a member of it. Hence, the first step,
after a contract of settlement, is the transfer of membership.</p>

<p>When the Council is organized the candidate is expected
to relate his Christian experience and his call to the
ministry, and to submit a statement of his views of Christian
doctrine, of church organization and discipline, and
of the ordinances. This statement may be either written
or unwritten. In any case, it should be clear, orderly,
and full. The manner of its presentation should be
arranged between the moderator and the candidate. It
is usually found expedient to make the statement complete,
without interruption, and at its close submit to such
<span class="pagenum" id="p27">[p.&nbsp;27]</span>
questions as the Council may have noted and may propose,
the moderator calling up each topic separately and
in order, for that purpose. The candidate should also be
prepared to submit to the Council, if called for, his license
to preach, his certificate of graduation from the seminary,
and any other papers that may show his standing and
attainments. Those who officiate in the ordination are
usually nominated in part by the church and candidate
and in part by the Council, but all receive their formal
appointment from the Council. For the sermon and such
parts of the service as require elaborate preparation, a
previous designation perhaps ought ordinarily to be made
by the church or the candidate, if the ordination immediately
follows the examination. In selecting persons to
officiate it is evidently appropriate, as well as desirable,
that most of those chosen should be pastors of churches
in the vicinity, with whom the person to be ordained will
be most nearly connected in his work.</p>

<p>Ordination constitutes one of the chief epochs in a
minister&rsquo;s life. It should, therefore, be preceded and
attended with much self-examination and prayer, and
to be marked as a point of new and higher consecration
to Christ and His church. The obligations then assumed
in the care of souls are the weightiest that can rest on
man, and the vows then taken are made not only to
man, but also to God.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s3" class="tdc">SECTION III.</h3>

<p class="tdc">PUBLIC WORSHIP.</p>

<p>The interest and value of worship, as conducted in
most churches, depend chiefly on the pastor. The service
<span class="pagenum" id="p28">[p.&nbsp;28]</span>
is almost wholly led by him. It is, therefore, of the
highest moment not only that the sermon be thoroughly
studied, but also that his spirit be prepared to lead
and elevate the souls of the people in acts of devotion; for
instruction is not the only object of the service: it is intended
to inspire and lead souls in true, spiritual worship,
such as will be acceptable to God and profitable to the
people. Three things are here specially to be sought.</p>

<p>1. <i>Unity of thought.</i> Each occasion of worship should
ordinarily have one leading, pervading, governing thought
which shall individualize that occasion and distinguish it
from others. By this it is not meant that the subject
should always be advertised in the hymns and Scriptures
and prayers that precede the sermon; this might be unfortunate,
as interfering with the purpose of general worship.
But all parts of the service should be consistent
with the subject of the discourse, and should flow naturally
into it; if possible, nothing should be allowed
to enter which may divert from it. The assembly should
be dismissed filled with one subject and bearing away
one great thought. On this account it is usually better
to exclude all other subjects, both during and immediately
following public worship, and when a subject out
of the usual order is to be presented, such as some benevolent
object, to give up the entire service to that and
concentrate attention on it.</p>

<p>2. <i>Sustained interest.</i> The interest should rise with the
progress of the service, and find its highest point at the
close; otherwise, the good impressions made in the earlier
part are lost in the weariness and apathy of the later.
Failure in sustaining interest to the end may result from
several causes: (1.)&nbsp;Imperfect preparation, so that the matter
of the service is commonplace and uninteresting. In
this age of intense mental activity, a want of freshness,
<span class="pagenum" id="p29">[p.&nbsp;29]</span>
vigor, and variety of thought is at once felt by the people,
and the attention is lost. (2.)&nbsp;Defective, monotonous delivery,
which often destroys the force of the best thought.
For this the only remedy is persistent training, taken, if
possible, under a good elocutionist; and where such a
defect exists, to apply this remedy seems clearly the imperative
duty of a man whose success in his work depends
on power in public speech. (3.)&nbsp;Wearisome protraction of
the exercises. Few sermons hold the interest of a congregation
beyond half an hour. The effect of the first thirty
minutes is in most cases destroyed by seeking to force attention
through another fifteen or twenty. (4.)&nbsp;Too great
exhaustion of the physical and nervous force of the
preacher before the service in preparing for it. The pastor
should secure thorough rest of body and mind before
the Lord&rsquo;s Day services, so as to come to them fresh and
strong. It is better to leave the sermons unfinished than
to fail of this. Preserve at all hazards a high tone of
physical vigor and a healthful, elastic nervous organism;
otherwise, the speaking will lack force and magnetism, and
the most able and elaborate sermon will fall flat and powerless.
Some of the most successful preachers avoid all
severe study on Saturday, making that a day of rest and
recreation, that they may come to their Lord&rsquo;s Day work
with full nervous and physical vigor.</p>

<p>3. <i>Religious impression.</i> This is the chief design of religious
worship, so far as it is intended to influence men;
and however much an assembly may be interested in a
preacher, the thoughtful and judicious always feel a painful
lack if the service has not stirred their deeper religious
nature. The pulpit may be able, eloquent, intellectually
stimulating; but if it does not touch these inner springs
of the soul, it has fatally failed, and the great object of
public worship has not been secured.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p30">[p.&nbsp;30]</span>
I. <span class="smcap">Pulpit Decorum.</span></p>

<p>The spirit and bearing of a pastor in the pulpit have a
marked influence on the tone of public worship. If he
is devout and reverential, as conscious of being in the
house of God and of bearing a message from God, his
manner will inspire in the congregation a like reverence
for the sacredness of worship. The whole service will
receive tone from the spirit of its leader. Here I suggest:
1.&nbsp;A careless manner in the pulpit is to be avoided, either
in the posture or movements of the body, or in handling
the hymn-book and Bible when preparing for service; as
also is the opposite fault of a manner studied and artificial,
whose stiffness and formality repel sympathy and
give an icy chill to worship. Against both of these faults
a devout, reverential heart thoroughly pervaded by the
spirit of worship will be the best safeguard. 2.&nbsp;In the
pulpit the pastor should be, and should appear to be,
absorbed in his work and his message; any act on his part
which creates a doubt of this destroys the value of the
service to the people, and is to be carefully avoided. Thus,
if, before the opening of the service or during its progress,
he is listlessly gazing around the congregation as if occupied
in mentally commenting on them, or is engaged in
conversation with some brother-minister seated with him,
the impression is inevitable that the service does not absorb
him, and his power with the people is weakened alike
in his devotional exercises and in his preaching. 3.&nbsp;As
far as possible, all arrangements should be previously
made, so as to avoid, during the service, any necessity
for consultations with officers of the church; and all notices
to be given should be required to be handed in to
the pastor before the services begin and should be reduced
to the minimum in number and length. For any
<span class="pagenum" id="p31">[p.&nbsp;31]</span>
diversion of the attention from the service itself is ordinarily
an evil.</p>

<p>In all this, however, it is evident that a devout, reverent
spirit, thoroughly entering into the true idea of worship,
is of far higher moment than any formal rules; for such
a spirit will instinctively feel the proprieties of the sacred
time and place and will perpetually seek to realize its own
ideal of public service. Cowper has well
<span class="wsnw">said:<a id="s3_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#s3_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

&nbsp;A messenger of grace to guilty men.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cgap">II. <span class="smcap">The Service of Song.</span></p>

<p>This is one of the most difficult, as it is one of the most
important, parts of public worship. Much diversity exists
in the method of conducting it. Whether the singing
should be congregational or restricted to a choir; whether,
in the former case, it should be led by a choir or by a
precentor; whether an instrument should be used or only
human voices,&mdash;all these questions have been differently
answered. My own observation is that the method adopted
is of far less importance than the spirit with which the
method is pursued. An inferior method carefully and
enthusiastically pressed will give better results than the
best method poorly followed. In singing, as in preaching,
<span class="pagenum" id="p32">[p.&nbsp;32]</span>
the men rather than the method determine its effectiveness,
and in any church suffering from defective singing I
should seek rather to infuse enthusiasm and the spirit of
musical culture in the singers than to change hastily any
method to which they had become accustomed.</p>

<p>Here, then, I suggest: 1.&nbsp;The pastor should feel and
should manifest a hearty sympathy for the singers and
an appreciation of their work; the lack of this is a frequent
cause of discouragement and disorganization in
choirs. He should consult with them in regard to the
musical interests of the congregation, should recognize
their work as an important service done to Christ and
the church, should express, in public and private, his
appreciation of whatever is excellent in their performances,
and should use his pastoral influence to secure
from the congregation the necessary means for such books
and instruments as may be important to their success.
A good choir, besides contributing the results of long
previous training, spend much time each week in practice
for the service of the Lord&rsquo;s Day, and no true pastor
should fail, or allow his congregation to fail, in an appropriate
expression of appreciation of the work thus done.
Such a spirit in pastor and people will seldom fail to
secure a well-trained and enthusiastic choir and will
make the service of song a power and a blessing in public
worship. 2.&nbsp;In the selection of hymns special adaptation
to the subject of the sermon is important chiefly
in the one which follows it; the others, especially the first,
while fittingly leading to the sermon, should be adapted
to the purposes of general worship. When the singing
is congregational, regard must be had to the tunes as
well as to the hymns; for in most congregations the
range of tunes in which the people can or will unite is
comparatively narrow, and the best hymn will fail with
<span class="pagenum" id="p33">[p.&nbsp;33]</span>
an impracticable tune. The pastor, therefore, should
carefully note the tunes which the congregation readily
sing, and make his selection within this range. A few
months&rsquo; observation, with careful noting of results, will
enable him to select wisely. 3.&nbsp;Singing in public worship
should be devotional. It is not a musical recreation
nor an artistic musical display, but an act of worship
offered to the Most High. The language of sacred song
is often directly addressed to God in praise, thanksgiving,
and prayer; it is, therefore, of doubtful propriety to
call for singing, while a collection is taken up or business
is transacted, merely to occupy the time. Nor should
the preacher, during the singing, allow himself to be
occupied in conversation, or in the study of his sermon;
rather he should, if possible, himself participate devoutly
with the congregation in this act or worship, and thus
by his example recognize the devotional nature of the service.</p>

<p class="cgap">III. <span class="smcap">Reading of the Scriptures.</span></p>

<p>The reading of the Bible should form a part of public
worship, both because it is the fitting recognition of
Scripture as the Word of God and the church thus presents
itself as reverently seeking instruction from Him,
and because the omission of this would imply that the
words of man are of higher moment than the words of
God. The Scriptures should have a large and reverent
use in the pulpit, as the fountain of all instruction and
the sole standard of faith and practice.</p>

<p>1. <i>The selection.</i> Here several suggestions may be made:
(1.)&nbsp;The passage should be adapted to the purposes of
devotion. Thus, a selection from Leviticus giving minute
regulations in regard to leprosy, or one made from the
long genealogical lists of Chronicles, however instructive
to the student of the Mosaic system or Jewish history,
<span class="pagenum" id="p34">[p.&nbsp;34]</span>
might not be the most helpful to devotion in a Christian
congregation. The primary end in any selection is instruction
adapted to inspire devotion. (2.)&nbsp;The passage
should be, in its character and tone, in harmony with
the subject of the sermon, but it need not be the passage
from which the text is taken. If the text has an extended
connection&mdash;and an understanding of this is important
to the force of the sermon&mdash;then this may be selected,
unless, as would rarely be the case, it is unfitted to aid
devotion. Often, however, a related passage presenting
and illustrating the subject of the text may be a wiser
selection, and sometimes a devotional passage having
no special reference to the text may be of more interest
and value. (3.)&nbsp;Some read a selection from both Testaments.
In such case the passages selected should harmonize
in general teaching and tone. This method has
the advantage that, while it reverentially recognizes
the Old Testament, it often strikingly presents the harmony
between the Old Testament and the New, and thus shows
the essential unity of the Bible as in all parts the utterance
of the one Spirit. (4.)&nbsp;The length of the passage
selected must depend, to some extent, on the subject of
it, for it should, at least in some measure, have completeness.
The reading service should always occupy
such prominence as to show a true reverence for God&rsquo;s Word.
Any abridgment of it, such as might suggest that the
preacher thought his sermon of higher moment, would
obviously be unfortunate. The pastor himself, when he
knows the ordinary limit for the whole service, can best
determine the amount of time to be occupied by this part
of it, and especially as he marks the extent of the interest
of the congregation in it, for no part of worship should
reach the point of weariness.</p>

<p>2. <i>The reading.</i> Effective reading of Scripture in the
<span class="pagenum" id="p35">[p.&nbsp;35]</span>
pulpit is a comparatively rare attainment. Many able
preachers fail in this&mdash;a failure which probably arises
from an undue concentration of interest on the sermon,
and consequent want of care in preparing for this service.
This, however, is undoubtedly a mistake. A correct expression
in reading is the best commentary on Scripture
and is often the most effective way of developing and
enforcing truth. No minister should allow himself to
fail of power in this. The following remarks may here
be of value: (1.)&nbsp;The passage should be carefully studied,
so that its true meaning, not only in its general scope, but
also in the connection of its separate thoughts, be thoroughly
understood. Without this the emphasis will often
be misplaced and the truth thus be obscured. (2.)&nbsp;It
should be so studied that its thought shall fully permeate
the mind of the reader and enlist his sympathy, for
only thus will the modulations and tones of his voice give
a natural and clear expression of the passage. Without
this sympathy a practical elocutionist may indeed develop
the thought, but his emphasis and tones will of necessity
be artificial, and he must fail to make the thought a power
to touch the springs of emotion and conviction in the
hearers. (3.)&nbsp;True expression in emphasis and tone will
often be attained simply by attending to the above suggestions;
but in some instances, false habits in reading
have become so fixed that only thorough elocutionary
drill can break them up. In this case the duty of the
young minister is plain: he should take all possible
means to remove such an obstruction to his pulpit
power.</p>

<p>3. <i>Comments.</i> On the question whether the minster
should make a running commentary on the passage
while reading, there are several points to be considered:
(1.)&nbsp;It is doubtful whether such an interjecting of man&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum" id="p36">[p.&nbsp;36]</span>
words among the words of God, though elucidating possibly
here and there an obscure point, does not on the whole
mar the impression of the passage as the Word of God, and
whether the simple reading of the Bible, with just emphasis
and expression, is not more instructive and impressive
than a reading thus broken up into fragments by interjected
comments. I confess that this doubt grows on me with
added observation and experience, and my impression is
that in most cases the majesty and power of the Scriptures
will be most distinctly presented in a careful reading, without
commingling the words of man with the words of God.
(2.)&nbsp;Besides, such comments require time, and the practice
thus tends to an undue protraction of public worship,
seriously interfering with the Sunday-school when, as in
many places, it immediately follows the service. (3.)&nbsp;Few
men possess the gift for such an exercise. Spurgeon, indeed,
has it in an eminent degree, and makes effective use of it.
This is true, perhaps, of some others, but most men fail; and
if there is a failure, it is here a most serious one. My advice,
therefore, is that, unless a minister have special aptitude
for it, he should not attempt this form of exposition,
but in the public reading of the Scriptures make his best
effort to develop and impress God&rsquo;s thoughts in the simple,
right reading of them.</p>

<p class="cgap">IV. <span class="smcap">Public Prayer.</span></p>

<p>Public prayer is the worship of the church presented
audibly through its representative or leader. The minister
gives vocal expression to the devotions of the assembly.
But it is more than this. The public prayer not only
gives a voice to the devotions of the people: it stimulates
the thoughts and desires of the assembly, and gives direction
and form to them, so that their hearts are quickened
and borne heavenward by the prayer of the leader. It
<span class="pagenum" id="p37">[p.&nbsp;37]</span>
is here the pastor&rsquo;s heart touches most directly the hearts
of the people, and all the spiritual forces of his nature
are felt, inspiring, guiding, and helping souls in their
approach to God. Power here, therefore, depends, not so
much on the observance of any special rules, however
judicious, as on a soul habitually living in the Spirit,
and thus profoundly realizing spiritual verities and sympathizing
with the experiences and necessities of men.
A few suggestions, however, may be of value, and we
consider&mdash;</p>

<p>1. <span class="smcap">The Form.</span>&mdash;It should ordinarily be unwritten. Liturgical
forms are to be rejected for several reasons: they
have no example in the Scriptures; they did not come
into use until the general corruption of worship; they
serve to repress and fetter a devotional spirit both in the
minister and the people; and they cannot be adapted to
the varied, special exigencies of the congregation. But
prayer, though extemporaneous in form, is not necessarily
unpremeditated. The mind should, if possible, be lifted
into the sphere of devotion and filled with the subjects of
petition by previous reflection. Too often the pastor is
anxious only for the sermon, and leaves the prayer, both
in matter and form, to the moment of utterance; and an
ordinary result is the repetition of solemn commonplaces
which fail to inspire and lead the devotions of
the congregation.</p>

<p>2. <span class="smcap">The Matter.</span>&mdash;The best materials for prayer are
derived from the following sources: (1.)&nbsp;The devotional
parts of Scripture, made familiar by constant study. Bible
thoughts in Bible imagery are best, because so sacredly
linked with the experiences of all Christian hearts. These
never grow old, and they afford endless variety and
freshness. The mind should be thoroughly imbued
with their spirit and stored with their forms of expression.
<span class="pagenum" id="p38">[p.&nbsp;38]</span>
(2.)&nbsp;Secret prayer, constantly maintained, with a
deep and rich personal experience. More than any other
exercise, public prayer is the outflow of the minister&rsquo;s
inner life. His holiest experiences, gathered on his knees
in secret, here find unpremeditated expression, and elevate
and enrich and spiritualize the acts of public devotion.
(3.)&nbsp;A full, heartfelt sympathy with the life of the people,
in their temptations, their sorrows, their hopes, and
their dangers. Their pastor&rsquo;s life should touch the life
of his people on every side, and his heart beat in perpetual
sympathy with them. Only thus can he truly lead
them in presenting their hearts&rsquo; desires before God. The
mere recluse whose life is with books and not with men,
who deals with ideas and not with experiences, may utter
an elegant, and even an eloquent, prayer; but he has no
power to inspire and lead souls, in these acts of public
devotion, to come with all their needs to the Throne of
Grace.</p>

<p>In respect to the matter of prayer, the following
cautions are to be observed: Avoid, (1.)&nbsp;Frequent references
to self. The minister is the medium of the devotions
of the people; whatever, therefore, cannot properly be
uttered by the assembly should not, ordinarily, be uttered
by the pastor. Any intimations in the prayer respecting
the pastor&rsquo;s health or the pressure of his work, intended
as an apology for a poor sermon or as deprecating an
unfavorable criticism of it, indicate an unmanly weakness
which is unworthy of the pulpit and is quickly felt by
the discerning. A petition asking Divine help for the
pastor in his work is indeed eminently fitting, for in this
the assembly may naturally unite; but when associated
with an apologetic purpose, looking only to the ear of
the people, such a prayer savors of impiety. (2.)&nbsp;Personalities.
Cases of deep affliction do indeed occur, which
<span class="pagenum" id="p39">[p.&nbsp;39]</span>
move the sympathy of a whole community, and in which
the person or family specially afflicted may properly be
directly alluded to in prayer; and this is true, also, of
any cases in which special request has been made for the
prayers of God&rsquo;s people. But beyond these limits it is
seldom wise to pass. Compliment or criticism in public
prayer is especially to be avoided. The temptation to
this is often great when another has preached for you;
but plainly the time and place alike make it unbefitting
thus to publish the pastor&rsquo;s estimate of a brother-minister&rsquo;s
character or sermon. (3.)&nbsp;All admonition or
scolding. This, though it is clothed in the language of
prayer to God, is, and will be felt to be, intended for the
ear of man; and, as in the preceding cases, it is an offensive
form of hypocrisy. But in this case, there is ordinarily
the added element of moral cowardice; for the
man utters in prayer to God what he would fear, when
looking his people in the face, to speak directly to them.
(4.)&nbsp;A didactic, doctrinal method in prayer. This is improper
alike in that it assumes the tone of instructing
God, and in that it is contrary to the nature of prayer.
For prayer is not a sermon; it is the outflowing of religious
emotion and desire toward God. It is, indeed a
means of instruction, but it teaches through the medium
of the emotional rather than the logical faculties. Prayer,
therefore, should never take the logical form, but
should ever be an expression, not dominantly of the
intellect, but of the heart.</p>

<p>3. <span class="smcap">The Order.</span>&mdash;Order in the topics has many advantages.
It concentrates attention on one subject at a time,
thus increasing the interest of both minister and people.
It aids the memory, thus avoiding the omission of necessary
subjects, and leaving the mind unconfused in recalling
them. An unarranged, confused prayer, in which the
<span class="pagenum" id="p40">[p.&nbsp;40]</span>
mind utters at haphazard whatever may first enter it,
must always fail of the true ends of public worship. A
natural and common order is this: invocation, adoration,
thanksgiving, confession, petition, and intercession. Invocation
recognizes dependence on the Divine Helper, the
Holy Spirit, and implores His presence and aid. In adoration
the character, perfections, and works of God are
celebrated, usually employing largely for this the language
and imagery of the Scripture, which in variety and
beauty has here a wealth simply inexhaustible. Thanksgiving
naturally comprehends the whole range of providential
mercies which attend our earthly life, personal,
local, and national, and also all those spiritual blessings
which spring from the Gospel in the experiences and
hopes of the personal life, and in the associations and
helps and prospects of the church of God. Confession
presents alike the individual soul, the church as a body,
and the community in the attitude of penitence, acknowledging
its sins and failures and humbly recognizing the
rectitude of the Divine judgment. Petition is prayer
offered in behalf of our own needs, imploring for the
individual soul and for the church, not only providential
favors, but also Divine illumination, penitence for sin,
faith in Christ, victory in temptation, support in trial,
growth in all the graces of Christian character, and success
in all the efforts of Christian labor. Intercession relates
more distinctly to those without us&mdash;the families represented
in the congregation, the Sunday-school and its
work, the afflicted, the unconverted, other Christian congregations
in the vicinity, the community with its varied
interests, the nation and its rulers, and the great missionary
work in its various departments and spheres of effort.
Each of these topics furnishes within itself a wide range
of subjects for prayer, and the pastor whose soul is in
<span class="pagenum" id="p41">[p.&nbsp;41]</span>
living sympathy with his people and his work, if he
makes proper preparation, may give to this part of
worship an endless variety and make it an exercise of
immense power. No one order, however, should be invariable,
for it leads to sameness of thought and language,
and thus has all the disadvantages of a stereotyped form,
with none of the advantages of a liturgy. The order,
with the selection of leading subjects in it, should be
a matter of careful premeditation, so that there may be
variety in the general plan of the prayer, while yet there
is no omission of necessary topics and no confusion.
Within such a general plan of prayer, mentally prearranged,
there will still be the amplest scope for those impromptu
utterances which the heart or the occasion may
suggest.</p>

<p>4. <span class="smcap">The Manner.</span>&mdash;This is not less important than in
preaching, and should be carefully considered, for the danger
of false habits here is even greater than in the sermon,
because in prayer the mind is less disposed to be self-critical.
And here: (1.)&nbsp;As to the posture of the body. The
Scriptures sanction both standing and kneeling. It should
be an attitude of reverence. Ordinarily there should be no
gesticulation. The eyes should be closed, the countenance
natural and serious. The speaker should remember that all
eyes before him are not closed, and any distortion or mal-expression
of his countenance, however innocent on his
part, is sure to be observed and provoke thought and
comment. (2.)&nbsp;The language should be simple, devout,
and scriptural. All rhetorical flourishes and attempts at
eloquence; all terms of endearment and familiarity with
God; all accumulation of the Divine names in one expression,
or use of frequent interjections, as oh! ah! etc.; and
all vulgarisms and oddities of expression, are to be carefully
avoided; they destroy the spirit of worship. The
<span class="pagenum" id="p42">[p.&nbsp;42]</span>
vulgar and thoughtless may applaud, but the judicious
and prayerful will be grieved; and all such characteristics
in prayer weaken the moral power of a minister and lessen
his usefulness. Reverence, naturalness, simplicity, are essential
in public devotion. (3.)&nbsp;The tone of voice should be
the natural expression of supplication. The faults especially
to be avoided here are such as these: a boisterous
tone, which, while it adds no force to the petition, wearies
both minister and hearer; an arrogant, commanding tone,
which is suggestive of irreverence; and a whining, complaining
tone. These false tones often originate in an unnatural
position of the head, which is thrown back, with
face turned upward; or forward, with face down, and the
organs of the voice thus injured. Throat disease among
ministers is due very largely to the unnatural use of the
vocal organs in prayer. Great care should be exercised
that the position of the head and the tone of the voice be
perfectly natural.</p>

<p>It is obvious that in public prayer a spirit imbued with
Divine influences is higher than all rules; it instinctively
recognizes the true proprieties of prayer; and this, therefore,
is chiefly to be sought. Nor do I forget that the
mental and spiritual idiosyncrasies of the man must here,
as in preaching, largely influence the manner, and may
sometimes justify in one what in another would be offensive.
But success in this service is so vital to the interest
of public worship, while failure is so frequent, that a pastor
should exercise constant self-scrutiny, often reviewing his
prayers to detect their defects, and often timing them so
as to know their length. The young pastor, especially,
should select some judicious, confidential friend in his
congregation who will faithfully point out defects, and
should thus, by a rigid process of self-discipline, secure at
the outset of his ministry right habits of prayer. For
<span class="pagenum" id="p43">[p.&nbsp;43]</span>
then while body and mind are yet plastic, the power of
a false habit may be broken, and the man may be molded
anew; but a few years&rsquo; persistence will fix the habit beyond
possible change, and ensure its weakening, perhaps fatal,
power through life.</p>

<p class="cgap">V. <span class="smcap">Preaching.</span></p>

<p>Christ is the one great theme of the pulpit; around this
all other themes gather as to their center and end. Paul
said: &ldquo;We preach Christ crucified&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. i.&nbsp;23). He
states the message of the ministry: &ldquo;God was in Christ,
reconciling the world unto Himself, not imputing their
trespasses unto them; and hath committed unto us the
word of reconciliation. Now then we are ambassadors for
Christ, as though God did beseech you by us: we pray
you, in Christ&rsquo;s stead, be ye reconciled to God. For He
hath made Him to be sin for us, who knew no sin, that we
might be made the righteousness of God in Him&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor.
v.&nbsp;19&ndash;21). All true preaching, therefore, however wide the
range of its topics, has a real relation to Christ; and no
topic is fit for the pulpit which does not lead to Him. The
themes of the preacher are essentially the same in all ages,
for the human heart, in its depravity and needs, does not
change with changing years; and God&rsquo;s remedy, the simple,
primitive Gospel, remains ever the same. The facts,
the doctrines, the duties, the promises, the threatenings, of
the Bible are the subjects for the pulpit; none are needed
beyond those supplied in God&rsquo;s Word. The effective preachers
in all ages have adhered to the same great truths; they
have differed only in modes of illustrating and applying
them. The idiosyncrasies of the preacher and the circumstances
of his times necessarily modify the form of presentation,
but the subject-matter of the ministerial message
is unchangeable.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p44">[p.&nbsp;44]</span>
<span class="smcap">Sermons.</span></p>

<p>The Gospel furnishes an exhaustless supply of topics.
Every minister should, however, use great care to secure
copiousness and variety of matter and illustration. The
best means are such as these: 1.&nbsp;The constant, careful
study of the Bible itself. Its words are the words
of God, living and powerful. &ldquo;They are spirit, and they are
life&rdquo; (John vi.&nbsp;63); and the pastor who makes this Divine
book his chief study has a mind filled, not with the
feeble, evanescent thoughts of man, but with the quickening,
eternal thoughts of God. The difference is world-wide
between a sermon filled with God&rsquo;s thoughts and
delivered as God&rsquo;s Word&mdash;a Divine message to men&mdash;and
one which is a philosophical discourse wrought out of
the preacher&rsquo;s own mind, and resting its authority on the
mere force of human reasoning; and this difference is not
simply in the unspeakably greater power of the former
to stir and save the souls of the hearers, but also in the
ever-increasing power of the preacher in sermon preparation,
arising from the absolute inexhaustibleness of the
materials for such a sermon. Some able and laborious
men early exhaust themselves and fail of richness and
power in the pulpit because their sermons are spun out
of their own brain rather than from God&rsquo;s Word. They
draw from the finite instead of the infinite fountain, and
the waters necessarily fail. 2.&nbsp;A rich personal religious
experience. All hearts are essentially alike, and he will
best know other hearts who most truly knows his own.
The power of a pastor depends largely on his knowledge
of the heart and its experiences under the influences of
the Gospel. This is more than a knowledge of human
nature as delineated in Shakespeare and works of fiction,
valuable as this is; it is a knowledge of the human soul
<span class="pagenum" id="p45">[p.&nbsp;45]</span>
under the power of sin and of the Holy Spirit, as its
experiences are delineated in the Bible and in the religious
life and are realized in his own soul. 3.&nbsp;An intimate
acquaintance with the religious state of the individuals
composing his own congregation in their special
tendencies, temptations, and experiences. Almost every
religious conversation will suggest new topics of living
interest for sermons. 4.&nbsp;Habitual reading of the best
religious authors, especially works on theology, exegesis,
and experimental religion. 5.&nbsp;A careful preservation of
texts, subjects, trains of thought, and illustrations, by
noting them down as they occur. These are continually
presenting themselves in the social meeting, in pastoral
visits, in reading, and in reflection. No man can afford
to lose these. They should be preserved to enrich and
make effective the work of the pulpit, and so preserved as
to be readily utilized; for one may have large accumulations
of such materials, but if they are not grouped
under appropriate headings and made easily accessible,
they may be comparatively useless, because eluding the
search at the moment of need.</p>

<p>The subjects of the sermon have been divided into the
doctrinal, the experimental, and the practical; but, in
preaching, the end is usually best attained by blending
these, or rather by presenting each truth in an experimental
and practical manner. This division, however,
is correct, as made according to the dominant, leading
idea of the sermon.</p>

<p>1. <i>Doctrinal sermons.</i> Much is said in regard to preaching
Christ, and not doctrine. But how is it possible to
preach Christ apart from doctrine? Christ is not an
abstraction, but a living, personal Being. If, then, we
preach Him, we must preach His Divinity, His humanity,
and His mediatorship between God and man. If we
<span class="pagenum" id="p46">[p.&nbsp;46]</span>
preach what He has done, we must declare His humiliation,
His death, and the atonement He has therein made
for sin. If we preach Him as He is, we must proclaim
His enthronement in heaven, His intercession with the
Father, and His Headship of the church, with all the
laws and ordinances He has instituted for it. And if we
preach Him as He shall be, we must affirm the final
triumph of His Gospel, His second coming, the resurrection
and the judgment, and the glory to which He will raise
His people with Himself. It is not possible to preach
Christ apart from doctrine; for His incarnation and
vicarious death presuppose the Fall and depravity and
guilt of men, and the need of regeneration, justification,
and sanctification; and His resurrection and glorification
equally involve the resurrection and glorification of His
church. All the doctrines of Scripture thus center in
Christ, and we preach Him only as we preach them.
Here, therefore, is the true power of the pulpit. Only
as the sermon lodges these great truths in the soul is it
a living force for the salvation of men. They constitute
the sole foundation of genuine experience and practical
appeal. A merely hortatory ministry is of necessity a
failure, since it lays no basis for experience and Christian
life in the convictions of the people. In presenting the
doctrines the following cautions should be observed:
(1.)&nbsp;Beware of doctrinal one-sidedness. Every mind has
its special theological tendencies; there is thus danger of
pushing a single truth, or a class of truths, into too great
relative prominence. A one-sided and, in its whole impression,
a false view of the Gospel may in this way be
presented. Seek rather to unfold a well-proportioned
system of truth, where every doctrine is not only true
in itself, but also stands in its just relations, alike of position
and prominence, to all other truths. For it is possible,
<span class="pagenum" id="p47">[p.&nbsp;47]</span>
while preaching nothing but the truth, to put a truth
in such false relations as to give it practically all the effect
of error. (2.)&nbsp;Avoid, ordinarily, the controversial form
in presenting subjects; its tendency is to put the mind
of the hearer in an attitude of antagonism. Indeed, a
controversial sermon, however well reasoned, will often
suggest more doubts than it removes. Doubtless, controversy
is sometimes necessary, as in defense of some imperiled
truth or principle; but the controversial form, as
an ordinary characteristic of preaching, is most seriously
to be deprecated. (3.)&nbsp;A dry, formal, metaphysical
method is also to be carefully avoided; it is entirely unadapted
to a popular assembly. The sermon is not a
theological essay; and the preacher, therefore, in dealing
with hungry souls, should ever remember, as John Newton
suggests, the important distinction between bones
and meat.</p>

<p>2. <i>Experimental Sermons.</i> Here it is vitally important
to make a clear discrimination between the genuine and
the spurious in religious experience. The welfare and
comfort of souls depend much on this, but it is one of the
most delicate and difficult parts of a pastor&rsquo;s work. Experimental
preaching is sometimes decried as tending to
turn the minds of the people inward upon their own hearts,
rather than upward upon Christ, and as thus creating a
habit of morbid introspection and weakening the power
of Christian hope and Christian life. Undoubtedly, there
is a real danger of this where the preaching is predominantly
of this character; and a pastor, especially if his
own spiritual tendency is intensely subjective, must be on
his guard lest he present this side of truth in undue proportion,
and thus hinder instead of helping the souls of
his charge. But no minister should fail to preach experimental
sermons; for nothing is more obvious than the
<span class="pagenum" id="p48">[p.&nbsp;48]</span>
large place experience has in Scripture, and the urgency
and frequency of its exhortations to self-examination.
Self-knowledge is of primary moment, and the pulpit
should be helpful to this. The presentation of objective
truth, apart from the subjective, tends to self-deception
and ends in Antinomianism. The Bible is wonderfully
rich and full in its delineation of character; and a careful
study of these Divine pictures of life will greatly aid
in the work of skillful discrimination. The Psalms, the
Prophets, the Gospels, and the Epistles abound in statements
defining true and false experience, discriminating
between &ldquo;the works of the flesh&rdquo; and &ldquo;the fruit of the
Spirit.&rdquo; Such books also as Edwards on <i>The Affections,</i>
Fuller on <i>The Backslider,</i> Doddridge&rsquo;s <i>Rise and Progress of
Religion in the Soul,</i> and Hodge&rsquo;s <i>Way of Life</i> are of value,
often suggesting important lines of discrimination. Added
to these, the study of his own heart and an intimate knowledge
of the experience and character of his people will
prove eminently helpful to the minister in such sermons.
On this I suggest: (1.)&nbsp;The spiritual principles by which
the true and false experience may be distinguished should
be made clear and distinct. A common fault in such discourses
is that they state and insist on certain exercises as
characteristic of Christian experience, but do not show why
they are so. The hearers are not put in possession of the
principle which makes such characteristics essential. Or
there is a denunciation of certain exercises as not Christian
without developing the principle which demonstrates
their spuriousness. (2.)&nbsp;Avoid any attempt to make all
experiences fit into the same mold. Religious experience
has endless diversity in form, while yet in all persons it
has certain well-defined common characteristics. The consciousness
and acknowledgment of sin as the one hope of
acceptance, the trust of the soul in Christ, the submission
<span class="pagenum" id="p49">[p.&nbsp;49]</span>
of the will in a complete self-surrender to God, then will
appear with greater or less distinctness in all regenerate
souls. Thus also, in the experiences of the Christian there
is endless variety in form, in special doubts and fears,
special temptations, special tendencies to sin, special manifestations
of self-will, pride, self-righteousness, and self-indulgence;
and in like manner faith and love, hope and
joy, and every Christian exercise have various forms of
manifestation in different souls. Here, then, the point to
be emphasized is that, in discriminating between the true
and the false in religious experience, the thing of vital
moment is the <i>nature</i> of the exercise, and not the form or
manner of its manifestation. (3.)&nbsp;It seems hardly necessary
to add that frequent reference to self, as setting
up one&rsquo;s own experience as a standard, is not only in bad
taste, but is also of bad tendency as directing from the true
standard found alone in God&rsquo;s Word.</p>

<p>3. <i>Practical Sermons.</i> The symmetry and beauty of
Christian character, and the consequent power of Christian
life, much depend on the wisdom and fidelity with
which the pulpit presents the duties of religion. The
New Testament reveals a sublime system of Christian
morals which, clearly unfolded and properly pressed, will
elevate and ennoble the life of the church. Here the
pulpit has one of its widest and noblest fields of effort.
The education of the Christian conscience is one of its
primary and most imperative functions; for an orthodox
creed and a regenerate heart may be very possible where,
from lack of moral instruction and culture, the life is
sadly defective. The soul is indeed regenerated, but the
new life is not developed in the conscience by the enlightening
of the moral judgment and quickening of the
moral sensibilities. True ideals of Christian living have
not been formed, and the outward character, instead of
<span class="pagenum" id="p50">[p.&nbsp;50]</span>
being a magnet radiant with the beauty of holiness and
attracting men to Christ, is marred by moral blemishes
which reproach the Gospel and repel men from Christ. The
widespread demoralization of late in business life, manifest,
too often even among Christian men, in the absence
of integrity and of fidelity to trust, should at least suggest
the question whether the pulpit has adequately
set forth and enforced the morality of the Gospel. I suggest
the following hints: (1.)&nbsp;In presenting a duty the grounds
of its obligation should be clearly unfolded, that the conscience,
thus enlightened, may be awakened to full power
in pressing its discharge. No permanent obedience will
be secured until the conscience distinctly perceives the
ground of obligation or the moral principles on which
the duty rests; nor does the performance of the duty,
apart from this clear recognition of the moral grounds of
it, serve to purify and elevate the character. It is the
enthronement of an ethical principle within the conscience,
and not the mere blind performance of an outward
act, which enlarges and ennobles the man.
(2.)&nbsp;The motives urged should be evangelical, not legal, drawn
from the Christian&rsquo;s relations to Christ, appealing not to
fear only or chiefly, but to love. The moral helplessness
of a Christian soul, when acting under the impulsion
only of legal fear, is vividly portrayed by Paul in the
seventh chapter of Romans, where with graphic power
he depicts his own fruitless strivings for the good when
impelled by the law, and the utter defeat and despair to
which he was reduced. Christ alone is the life, and only
faith in Him brings victory to any soul in the conflict with
sin. His character is the great ideal set before a Christian
soul, and His love the impulsive force in seeking to
realize it: &ldquo;The love of Christ constraineth us&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. v.&nbsp;14).
A true Christian life is the outflow of grateful, adoring
<span class="pagenum" id="p51">[p.&nbsp;51]</span>
love to Him. Motives drawn from the soul&rsquo;s relations
to Him, therefore, alone move the Christian heart and
have permanent power to impel to God and holiness.
(3.)&nbsp;Ministerial fidelity doubtless requires a plain presentation
of duties and a fearless exposure of sin, but it is
seldom wise to employ the style of denunciation. A
cheap reputation for boldness and fidelity is sometimes
thus obtained among the unthinking, but most men know
that at this day denunciation from the pulpit requires no
moral courage and will be likely to regard it as a sensational
bid for popularity. True boldness shows itself not
so much in the manner as in the matter of the sermon.
It consists in exposing clearly and fearlessly popular forms
of error and wrong, and applying to them, in all plainness
and sincerity, the principles of the Gospel. Here,
while real boldness in manner should never be wanting,
true persuasiveness in manner should always be preserved,
thus avoiding needless irritation.</p>

<p>In the selection of subjects, I suggest: (1.)&nbsp;The subject
should be, as far as possible, adapted to the existing state
of the people. This requires an intimate, vital relation
between the life of the pastor and the actual living of the
people, for the isolated recluse will waste much of his pulpit
work on subjects which do not touch the real experiences
and life of his hearers. (2.)&nbsp;Every subject should
be selected with earnest prayer for Divine guidance. God
alone knows what are the real needs of those who will
hear; and a theme thus chosen is delivered with authority
as a message from Him, for a sermon is a growth with
the preacher&rsquo;s soul, possessing vitality and power as the
product of the Holy Spirit; and when thus obtained from
God by the inworking of the Spirit, it becomes to the
hearers a Divine message such as should be borne by
&ldquo;ambassadors for Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p52">[p.&nbsp;52]</span>
<span class="smcap">Exposition.</span></p>

<p>This method of preaching has of late years gone into
disuse, partly because success in it is really difficult to attain,
and partly because, the Bible having ceased to be the
chief reading of the churches, the popular interest in exposition
has decreased; but when rightly followed it has
advantages, both to minister and people, beyond those of
any other form of preaching.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Advantages to the Preacher.</span>&mdash;It promotes exegetical
study and acquaintance with the original Scriptures, the
neglect of which is fostered by an exclusively topical
method. The process is an ever-enriching one, constantly
widening the range of biblical and theological
knowledge. It ensures against sameness. Instead of
growing stale, the preacher becomes more rich and varied
in his range of thought and illustration with every
added year. It gives, moreover, familiarity with the
forms of Scripture thought and expression, and thus
adds simplicity and force in addressing the Christian
heart. Above all, it brings the preacher&rsquo;s soul into constant,
living communion with the spirit of the Bible, and
the study becomes in this way a fountain of religious life
ever flowing into his heart, and out of it into the hearts
of the people.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Advantages to the Congregation.</span>&mdash;It is obvious that
such a method of preaching would serve to remove many
of the popular doubts and difficulties with the Bible which
are at this day so greatly weakening its hold on the masses.
It would enable the preacher to put before the people the
results of modern historic, arch&aelig;ological, and geographical
investigation which have thrown so great light on the
Bible and so greatly confirm its truth. Such treatment
of the Scriptures in the pulpit would also lead to a discriminating
<span class="pagenum" id="p53">[p.&nbsp;53]</span>
use of them, as well as familiarity with them,
among the people It would necessarily develop the principles
of interpretation, and thus educate the people in
right methods of using the Bible, making it of far higher
value to them. And, more than all, it would accustom
Christians to rest their faith, not on the mere dogmas of
the pulpit and the creed, but on the very words of God,
and would furnish a basis of religious confidence which
can never be shaken. The modern pulpit, from its neglect
of the Bible, is singularly narrow, exhibiting little of the
vast wealth and variety of Divine truth. It leaves by far
the larger part of the Bible a sealed book. Its types, its
poetry, its prophecies, its parables, its presentations, as in
the Epistle to the Romans, of the truths of the Gospel in
their connection as one grand, comprehensive system of
salvation&mdash;how little of all this wealth of Scripture is presented
in the pulpit! The result is, and must necessarily
be, the absence of depth and fulness of Christian life in
the church and the complaint of a loss of power in the
pulpit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hints on Method.</span>&mdash;1.&nbsp;The pastor should select for
exposition such parts of Scripture as are susceptible of
intelligent explanation to a promiscuous congregation.
The symbolic visions of Ezekiel and of Revelation might
awaken curiosity, but except under extraordinary circumstances
could hardly be profitable for such an exercise.
2.&nbsp;Divide the selected portion into sections, each sufficient
for a sermon, and as far as possible let each have a
single general topic. This secures unity in the discourse.
For example, the first chapter of the Sermon on the Mount
might be divided thus:</p>

<p>I. Vs. 1&ndash;12. <i>The beatitudes:</i> Happiness, its source not
external, but internal; not material, but spiritual.</p>

<p>II. Vs. 13&ndash;16. <i>Relation of the disciples to the world:</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="p54">[p.&nbsp;54]</span>
Christians God&rsquo;s medium of saving influence and spiritual
knowledge among men.</p>

<p>III. Vs. 17&ndash;20. <i>Relation of Christ to the Old Testament:</i>
Christ not the destroyer, but the fulfiller, of the ancient
law.</p>

<p>IV. Vs. 21&ndash;48. <i>The law as interpreted by Christ:</i> Sin,
not in the overt act only, but also in the secret thought.</p>

<p>1st example (vs. 21&ndash;26): The law of murder.</p>

<p>2d example (vs. 27&ndash;32): The law of adultery.</p>

<p>3d example (vs. 33&ndash;37): The law respecting oaths.</p>

<p>4th example (vs. 38&ndash;48): The law of retaliation.</p>

<p>The first three of the above divisions and the four
examples under the fourth would each furnish a fitting
passage for a sermon with a single and well-defined
general theme. Much of Scripture is susceptible of
equally distinct division, so that the preacher will rarely
fail of unity in his discourse. 3.&nbsp;Develop the general
theme by explaining the several parts of the passage, so
as to unfold the special phase of the truth which the
Holy Spirit there presents. Take, for example, Rom. v.&nbsp;1&ndash;11.
Here, in the progress of the apostle&rsquo;s argument,
the general theme is: <i>The effects of justification by faith in
the believer.</i> These effects are four: (1.)&nbsp;vs. 1, 2, the perfect
adjustment of his relation to God. (2.)&nbsp;vs. 3&ndash;5,
the transmuting of earthly trial into blessing. (3.)&nbsp;vs.
6&ndash;10, the absolute certainty of his eternal salvation.
(4.)&nbsp;v. 11, a delight in the Divine character as God is
revealed through Christ in the atonement. The several
points made in the passage itself thus constitute the
inspired development and illustration of the main theme
and indicate the direction and method of the exposition.
4.&nbsp;Having thus developed the theme by an analysis and
exposition of the passage, deduce the inferences as to
doctrine and duty, and make a practical application to
<span class="pagenum" id="p55">[p.&nbsp;55]</span>
the heart and conscience. The inferential development
is often very important, as affording manifold and vital
applications of truth to character, to Christian experience
and life, and to the various forms of error and
sin. Nowhere is the value of expository preaching more
manifest than in the wide range and the special power
of its practical application. 5.&nbsp;Avoid in exposition verbal
criticism, parade of learning, allusion to commentators,
or reference to different views of the passage; it
impairs the interest and weakens the moral effect. The
critical apparatus should be carefully used in the study,
but it has no place in the pulpit. It is mere scaffolding,
which should disappear when the structure is finished.
In the sermon the work of the study should appear, not
in its processes, but only in its results. The citing of
conflicting opinions on a passage will, as a general fact,
only perplex the people. Ground your interpretation
on thorough and conscientious study, and then present
clearly and strongly the results. A doubting manner
awakens doubt; and the pulpit, therefore, while avoiding
an offensive dogmatism, should be positive in its presentations
of God&rsquo;s Word. A good expository sermon costs
far more labor than any other, but it is also of far higher
value to preacher and hearer. Without thorough preparation
no one should undertake exposition; for, superficially
done, it is sure to fail. But success in this highest
form of preaching is an achievement worthy of the
preacher&rsquo;s highest effort and is of unspeakable importance.
The mightiest pulpit power of Chrysostom and
Augustine, of Luther and Calvin, was in their expository
sermons. Chalmers and Andrew Fuller were powerful
in exposition; and this form of the sermon is still a
chief characteristic of the British pulpit, as illustrated
in many of its most illustrious preachers. Dr. William
<span class="pagenum" id="p56">[p.&nbsp;56]</span>
M. Taylor, of the Broadway Tabernacle, New York, gives
one sermon each Lord&rsquo;s Day to exposition, and makes it
a blessing and power.</p>

<h3 id="s4" class="tdc">SECTION IV.</h3>

<p class="tdc">SOCIAL DEVOTIONAL MEETINGS.</p>

<p>The practical success of a pastor greatly depends on
the effectiveness of the social meetings, yet much tact
and constant attention are required in conducting them.
The impressions of the sermon here become deeper and
often reach definite results in conversion, while here also
the gifts and spiritual power of the church find development.
The pastor who devotes himself only to the pulpit,
and makes this department incidental, whatever he
may become as a preacher, is likely to prove a pastoral
failure.</p>

<p class="cgap">I. <span class="smcap">The Prayer-Meetings.</span></p>

<p>In reference to these I offer the following suggestions:
1.&nbsp;The pastor himself should ordinarily conduct them
if they are general meetings of the church; no other can
so fully understand the condition of those present, or so
wisely adapt the exercise to their needs. Besides, the
instruction and spirit of the prayer-meeting should be
kept in harmony with the teaching of the pulpit, so as
to supplement it and develop its results; one mind, therefore,
should direct and inspire both. Where the meeting
is intended for a special class, as for the young people or
for the Sunday-school teachers, it may be proper, if there
is a suitable leader, for the pastor to be relieved and the
care of it to be entrusted to another.</p>

<p>Careful preparation of thought, but of especially of spirit
<span class="pagenum" id="p57">[p.&nbsp;57]</span>
should be made for the meeting. No man should trust
to the inspiration of the occasion either for the thought
which shall give the keynote to the meeting or for the
quickened spiritual life which, existing in the leader, shall
touch and quicken the life of the church. 2.&nbsp;Be punctual
in opening and closing at the appointed time; nothing so
effectually secures a prompt attendance, and the neglect
of it will prevent many from coming, especially females,
because they cannot know how late may be the hour of
dismission. 3.&nbsp;Be brief in your own exercises, showing
yourself a pattern, and insist on brevity in others, whether
in prayer, remarks, or singing. Let your opening remarks
be suggestive rather than exhaustive, so that when you sit
down the people, instead of feeling that all has been said,
will find the subject opening before them and be inspired
to carry out the thought into other phases and applications.
4.&nbsp;Avoid uniformity and monotony. To secure
natural variety, give each meeting its own keynote, now
of thanksgiving and praise, now of confession and humiliation,
now of Christian hope, and again of some great
truth or some practical duty. If it becomes evident,
as it sometimes will, that you have struck the wrong key
and thought and feeling are running in another channel,
throw yourself heartily into that and make the most of it.
If a pause occurs, be ready with a passage of Scripture,
a hymn or remark, or call on individuals either to pray
or relate experience, or to state some interesting fact you
may know they possess. A pastor in vital relations with
the people, by his knowledge of the experiences and condition
of the individuals before him, will be able to give
perpetual variety to the meetings by evoking in various
ways their experience and utilizing their power. 5.&nbsp;In
regard to the presentation of special cases for prayer, my
judgment is that this should be encouraged; since, even
<span class="pagenum" id="p58">[p.&nbsp;58]</span>
apart from the power of prayer with God in behalf of
such cases and the answer of blessing it brings, the special
presentation itself serves to give directness and fervency
to supplication and adds freshness and power to
the exercise. It is possible, however, to have too much
machinery in a prayer-meeting, making its movement
mechanical and destroying spontaneity. Expression of
interest in the subject of personal religion by rising or
other forms may be so often repeated as to be worse than
useless and become justly offensive. In calling, therefore,
for an expression, great care must be taken not to
overdo, and not to do it at all unless there is good reason
to expect a response. A failure usually chills the
interest of a meeting. 6.&nbsp;Use all exertions to bring the
gifts of the church into full exercise; there is always a
large amount of latent power which it should be the
special care of the pastor to develop and make effective
for Christ. This will not be done by scolding and
complaining, but rather by the diffusion of a spirit, an
atmosphere, in the meeting&mdash;an all-pervasive, homelike
feeling&mdash;which will banish embarrassment and draw them
out. The timid and backward may also be helped by an
occasional question, the answering of which will accustom
them to their own voices and induce spontaneous
expression. Something also maybe done in private
personal words of encouragement. Above all, place distinctly
before all minds the fact that in the prayer-meeting
the main thing, next to prayer, is the interchange of
Christian experience, and what is required, therefore,
from each one is, not a homily, an exposition, or an exhortation,
but a simple statement of what he has thought
and felt amidst the experiences of life; and, as every soul
has its own peculiar life, it has an experience of real value
as helpful and comforting to other lives. 7.&nbsp;Make careful
<span class="pagenum" id="p59">[p.&nbsp;59]</span>
arrangements for good spirited singing, but usually not
more than two or three verses at a time. To secure this,
if you do not yourself sing, arrange with one or more
good singers to lead whenever a pause occurs. Indeed,
if you are a singer, it is often best not to take on yourself
the responsibility of leading; the care is too much, and
by distracting and exhausting your force it may diminish
your power in the general guidance of the exercises.
Do not fail to have good books, with hymns and tunes,
in sufficient number to give all opportunity to join in the
singing. 8.&nbsp;Great care should be taken, if the room is not
full, to have people sit together and near the leader.
No meeting will ordinarily be <i>social,</i> in any proper sense,
where a few people are scattered in a large room. Attention
should also be given to the ventilation and temperature
of the room; otherwise, the meeting may fail from
purely physical causes, in spite of the best efforts of pastor
and people. Right physical conditions are simply
attempts to conform to God&rsquo;s physical laws, and are absolutely
essential to the highest success in social religious
meetings; no pastor, therefore, should deem them unworthy
of careful and persistent attention. Finally, it should
be remembered that it is a <i>social</i> meeting. Divest it of
all formality, stiffness, or sameness. Make it cheerful,
familiar, homelike, as a gathering of God&rsquo;s children in
their Father&rsquo;s family. If this is done, old and young
will be attracted to it, and will alike feel free to share its
services.</p>

<p class="cgap">II. <span class="smcap">The Covenant Meeting.</span></p>

<p>This was originally called the covenant meeting because
it was intended for the solemn renewal by the members
of their vow of consecration to Christ and the church, and
the church covenant was formally read in it while the
members stood to express their adhesion to it. Of late
<span class="pagenum" id="p60">[p.&nbsp;60]</span>
years, however, the meeting is less fully attended than
formerly, and the reading of the covenant is often deferred
to the opening services of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, that the
church may be more largely represented in the act. The
entire omission of its reading, as is sometimes the case, is
unfortunate, since many thus enter the church without a
full understanding of the obligations thus assumed, and
the church fails of the important stimulus to duty which
this solemn reading and renewal of the covenant is adapted
to furnish. The following hints may be of value: 1.&nbsp;In
a large church it is not possible, nor is it desirable, that all
the members should speak at one meeting: any attempt
to secure this will ordinarily result either in a wearisome
protraction of the service, or in so abbreviating the communication
of each as to render the exercise, as an interchange
of experience, of very slight value. Some ministers
lay special emphasis on the number of speakers they have
succeeded in compressing into an hour; but it is evident
that if each has not had adequate time to make a true expression
of his experience, the usefulness of the exercise is
seriously impaired, if not destroyed. It is not the number,
but the quality, which gives value to the experiences related
in a covenant meeting. As far as possible, however,
arrangements should be made that those not called on at
one meeting may be called on at the next, and on every
occasion the meeting should be thrown open before the
close, so as to give any specially-burdened heart opportunity
for expression. 2.&nbsp;Encourage frankness and brevity.
If members indulge in stereotyped expressions and prosy
speeches, break up the habit by pointing out its evil.
Many excellent Christians whose experience, if really
presented, would prove rich and valuable have no correct
idea of what should be spoken, and utter mere commonplaces
when they might speak words of gold. Suppose
<span class="pagenum" id="p61">[p.&nbsp;61]</span>
that, before calling on them to speak, you address them
somewhat in this way: &ldquo;Brethren, we have met to renew
our covenant with God and with each other. We want,
therefore, to know your <i>heart-history</i> since we last met at
the Lord&rsquo;s Table&mdash;that is, so far as it is proper to be
known, for some of it belongs between you and God
alone and should not be spoken here. But you have
had experiences which will help and cheer us. Temptations
have come to you&mdash;something, it may be, separated
you from the consciousness of Christ&rsquo;s presence. We want
to know how you got back to Him. You have had special
mercies in deliverance from disease or accident, in prospered
fortune, in friends raised up for you. Will you tell
how these mercies affected you? You have passed through
trial in sickness, in disappointments, in the death of loved
ones, in losses and sufferings. We would know how you
felt under trials, and how God helped you to bear them.
You have had special seasons of communion with Christ,
and have received special answers to prayer; you have
found some passages of Scripture truth or promise specially
opening to you; you have some personal friend or
friends for whom you are deeply interested that God may
save them. These are the things we want to know&mdash;just
what your heart has felt of late; and if in this family
gathering in our Father&rsquo;s house you will tell these, you
will help us and will bring all hearts into sympathy with
you.&rdquo; Such suggestions, occasionally made, will repress
tendencies to stereotyped thought and expression, and will
educe those heart-experiences which give life and power to
the meeting. 3.&nbsp;When there are candidates for baptism,
encourage them to speak fully and freely, and secure, if
possible, that they shall be heard by all. After the experiences
have fully come before the church, the candidates
should withdraw while their cases are under consideration,
<span class="pagenum" id="p62">[p.&nbsp;62]</span>
that the investigation of each case may be unembarrassed
and full opportunity be had for inquiry or objection.
4.&nbsp;Matters of business and of discipline are, as a rule, to be
avoided at the covenant meeting. They usually divert attention
from the special object of the exercise, and often
dissipate the spiritual impression. 5.&nbsp;Do not protract the
service. An hour and a half is usually as long as a profitable
interest can be maintained. Too often the benefit of
the meeting is wholly lost by its tediousness. A prompt
beginning and an equally prompt ending are essential to
sustained life in any exercise.</p>

<p class="cgap">III. <span class="smcap">The Inquiry Meeting.</span></p>

<p>The weekly inquiry meeting should constitute a part of
the system of pastoral work. It accustoms minister and
people to seek and expect immediate results from preaching
and Christian labor; and the value of this to both, as
an ever-present inspiration, is incalculable. Under every
earnest ministry there are always thoughtful, anxious souls;
but it requires tact and wisdom to bring them out and come
into close, personal contact with them. Few ministers are
aware of the extent of this latent conviction among the
unconverted under faithful preaching, or realize the importance
of systematic, effective means for developing it.
Here I suggest: 1.&nbsp;Let the meeting be held, if not on the
Lord&rsquo;s Day, as soon after it as practicable, that the impressions
made by its services may not have time to wear
away. This is a point of great moment. Some pastors
hold a meeting for prayer and inquiry immediately after
the evening sermon, while the impressions are still vivid
and fresh. This has sometimes proved very effective, especially
as serving to develop the conviction and make
known the persons under it, so that the pastor and church
may afterward devote special labor to them. At such a
<span class="pagenum" id="p63">[p.&nbsp;63]</span>
meeting, however, little more could ordinarily be done, in
personal conversation, than a few earnest words and the
noting of the address of inquirers, with the view of following
up the cases; and this, therefore, would not supersede
the necessity of a meeting where more deliberate conversation
could be had. 2.&nbsp;Christians should be instructed
and urged to bring thoughtful persons to the inquiry meeting&mdash;the
parent, his child; the Sunday-school teacher, his
pupils; the young convert, his friends&mdash;and to regard this
as a part of regular Christian work. In places where the
inquiry meeting is a novelty, its full, effective establishment
may require time; but, once thoroughly established,
the inquiry room will seldom lack inquirers. 3.&nbsp;Various
methods of conducting the meeting are adopted. One
method is to meet all the inquirers in one room and converse
with them in the presence of each other, as in a
Methodist class-meeting. To make this successful, the
pastor must have ready tact and large resources, or he
will repeat himself and the meeting fail from staleness.
But it has this advantage: inquirers in such a gathering
are drawn into a disclosure of their anxieties in the presence
of others, and this committal of themselves to the
subject is sometimes of great value in fixing impressions
and leading to a decision. Another method is to meet
them singly, or, if specially related to each other, in
groups, and let the conversation be private. This, when
practicable, is generally more satisfactory, as it gives opportunity
to probe the heart more fully, and to say much
you cannot so freely say before others. It is often of great
value not only to pray with an inquirer, but also to induce
him to pray with you. Sometimes, if you have set before
him distinctly the way of salvation, he will, in such a season
of prayer immediately following, then and there cast
himself on Christ and make a full surrender to Him. Perhaps,
<span class="pagenum" id="p64">[p.&nbsp;64]</span>
however, no one method will be adapted to all circumstances,
and the judgment of the pastor must be exercised
in fixing on one suited to himself and the special
exigencies of his position. 4.&nbsp;The pastor should be discriminating
and faithful in dealing with inquirers, for
failure in this may result in a superficial experience and
a false hope. In such conversations he should never content
himself with a mere, vague exhortation to come to
Christ; what the inquirer needs is definite instruction as
to what it is to come to Christ. Probe thoroughly, so as
to be sure that there is a genuine sense of sin, a reliance
alone on the righteousness of Christ, and an actual submission
of the will to God. The pastor should prepare
himself, therefore, for the exercise with fervent prayer, and
gather, and have at ready command a variety of Scripture
passages adapted to different religious conditions, and of
simple, clear illustrations of the nature of repentance and
faith. 5.&nbsp;Let your conversation with an inquirer ordinarily
be confidential, so that he may not feel, when conversing
with you, that he is talking to the town; otherwise, you
deter many from coming, and even with those who come
you may prevent what is important to your success&mdash;a
full disclosure of the heart. As a rule, also, it is not wise
to encourage an inquirer to seek conversation with many
different persons: the varied advice given confuses him
and tends to dissipate impressions. Finally, it is obvious
that success in this exercise will greatly depend on the tact,
geniality, and approachableness of the pastor himself. If
he is cold, stiff, and repellent in manner, it will be difficult
for him to secure the attendance and confidence of inquiring
souls. There may be real and deep religious anxieties,
but they remain latent from lack of power in the
pastor to develop them.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p65">[p.&nbsp;65]</span>
IV. <span class="smcap">Meeting for Examination of Candidates for
the Church.</span></p>

<p>No candidate should ordinarily come before the church
without a previous examination by the pastor; and notice,
therefore, should be given when and where he will meet
persons desiring to unite with the church.</p>

<p><i>Hints.</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;The time should be sufficiently early to give
ample opportunity for making inquiries respecting an
applicant, where the circumstances and character of the
individual are not known. In the case of minors, consult
the parents or guardians when practicable; it is a courtesy
due to them, whatever their religious character or relations,
and is often desirable in order to a full understanding
of the character of the candidate. 2.&nbsp;Let the examination
be thorough and faithful. The purity of the church,
as well as the welfare of the candidate, demands this. It
is far easier to arrest an application at this point than after
it comes to the church. The absence of knowledge even
of the fundamental principles of the Christian religion,
on the part of many who are hurried into the church, is
one of the alarming features of our time. Certainly,
Christian experience is not a matter of mere blind emotion;
and we have no ground for supposing its existence
apart from distinct convictions respecting God and Christ
and the foundation-truths of the Gospel. We are &ldquo;born
again by the Word of God;&rdquo; and there can be no &ldquo;repentance
toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo;
without some definite idea of sin, of repentance, of faith,
of God, and of Christ. It is never proper, therefore, to
assume the fact of a Christian experience where there is
no definite Christian knowledge. The duty in such cases
is to instruct, not to baptize. 3.&nbsp;See that the candidate
understands not only the general principles of Christianity,
<span class="pagenum" id="p66">[p.&nbsp;66]</span>
but also the distinctive doctrines and usages of the church
and the specific obligations assumed in becoming a church
member, so that his profession may be made intelligently.
For this purpose, have your Articles of Faith and Covenant
in printed form, and place a copy in the hands of
every candidate. This will often prevent misunderstanding
and subsequent difficulty; and the intelligence
with which the step is taken will add much to the value of the
profession. 4.&nbsp;It is well, when practicable, and especially
when any considerable number are to be examined, to
associate the officers of the church or some experienced
brethren with you in this preliminary examination, that
the responsibility may not all fall on you. For this,
though informal, is ordinarily the decisive examination;
the church very rarely rejects a candidate understood to
be approved by the pastor. In some churches, whenever
a name is proposed, a committee is appointed to hear the
experience of the candidate and make necessary inquiries,
and the candidate comes before the church only after
their favorable report. This has the disadvantage of
making public the name of an applicant and thus embarrassing
the rejection, should that be desirable; but it
has also the advantage of dividing the responsibility of
the examination and relieving the pastor. If a committee
is appointed, however, I think it should be a standing one,
with the pastor at its head, and the names of candidates
should be presented to it before being presented publicly
to the church. 5.&nbsp;Beware of an ambition for mere numbers:
a small body of well-instructed, earnest disciples is
worth far more to the cause of Christ than a heterogeneous
multitude undistinguished in spirit and life from the
world. Seek in this, not newspaper publicity and laudation,
but the approval of Christ, building the temple of
God, not with perishable material, &ldquo;wood, hay, and stubble,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum" id="p67">[p.&nbsp;67]</span>
but with imperishable, &ldquo;gold, silver, precious stones,&rdquo;
which shall endure when the &ldquo;fire shall try every man&rsquo;s
work of what sort it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="cgap">V. <span class="smcap">The Officers&rsquo; Meeting.</span></p>

<p>The officers of the church are the cabinet of the pastor,
and the responsibilities and labors of the spiritual watch-care
should be shared with them. A wise use of these assistants
will relieve him of many a burden which otherwise
he would needlessly bear and will secure a much more
general and effective supervision of the spiritual interests
of the church. For no pastor can accomplish all that needs
to be done; and if left to the church generally, very little
effective watch-care is exercised. Such consultation with
the officers will often save the pastor from mistakes, while
the division of labor greatly simplifies and relieves his
work. It affords, also, a sphere of real usefulness for the
deacons, and serves to develop their gifts and augment
their religious power.</p>

<p><i>Hints.</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;Have a regular meeting at convenient intervals&mdash;say
once a month or once in two months&mdash;and let
each officer be invited and made to share equally in the
counsels and responsibility, thus avoiding jealousies. Prepare
thoroughly the business to be brought before them,
so that there may be no delay. 2.&nbsp;After the opening
season of prayer, read carefully the list of church members,
and let each member needing special care be definitely
assigned to some one or more of the officers to give
at once the necessary attention. By this means any member
requiring a kindly suggestion or whose position is not
understood may be at once quietly reached; and, if in danger,
may be saved before the case has gone so far as to be
beyond help. If this is faithfully done, nearly all public
discipline may be avoided and the tone of church-life
<span class="pagenum" id="p68">[p.&nbsp;68]</span>
may be kept high and vigorous. 3.&nbsp;Let the general condition
and welfare of the church and plans for Christian
labor and church extension be here carefully considered;
for here methods for advancing Christ&rsquo;s cause through the
church most naturally originate and may be most wisely
matured. Great care should be taken, however, that the
meeting does not lose its religious tone and degenerate
into a mere clique for church management. It may be
made, by right guidance, a center of religious interest and
power in the congregation, while to the pastor it secures
the hearty confidence and co-operation of the trusted
counsellors and leaders of the church.</p>

<p class="cgap">VI. <span class="smcap">Church Meetings for Business.</span></p>

<p>These are properly classed among devotional meetings,
because the transaction of church business should always
be done in a devotional spirit and be connected with devotional
exercises.</p>

<p><i>Hints.</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;The pastor is, <i>ex officio,</i> the presiding officer
in all meetings of the church, and should ordinarily preside.
Ruling, presiding, is a function distinctly assigned
in the New Testament to the pastoral office (1&nbsp;Thess. v.&nbsp;12;
1&nbsp;Tim. iii.&nbsp;4, 5; Heb. xiii.&nbsp;17)&mdash;a function which would
seem clearly to include that of presiding in the assemblies
of the body. He should be familiar with the established
rules of order in deliberative bodies; but in applying
them he should not make a parade of parliamentary rules
nor ordinarily put them in the form of law. An easy,
quiet, prompt manner in presiding should be carefully
cultivated: it makes great difference in the effectiveness
and despatch of business and the comfort of the church.
2.&nbsp;Unanimity is to be earnestly sought; but when it cannot
be attained it is usual to accept the decision of the
majority. The reception of members, however, should
<span class="pagenum" id="p69">[p.&nbsp;69]</span>
be unanimous&mdash;certainly so far as the question relates to
Christian character; otherwise, members would enter whom
a part of the church do not fellowship. Ordinarily, objections
to an applicant may be avoided by proper care in
previous inquiries respecting him; but if made, the case
should be deferred, and a committee appointed to receive
and examine the objections. If the objections are evidently
made in a wrong spirit, the church should overrule
them, and the objectors, persisting, should be put under
discipline. It is evident that the careful pastor, foreseeing
such a result, would dissuade, if possible, the applicant
from presenting himself, and thus avoid discord in the
church, unless this course would inflict injury on the
candidate and cover up wrong in the church. 3.&nbsp;Secure,
if possible, a full attendance of members, and make the
meeting thoroughly religious in its tone and spirit. The
contempt into which church disciplinary action sometimes
falls is often due to the fact that few members are
present, and the moral power, therefore, of the church is
not behind their action, and that the manner, if not the
spirit, of their proceedings befits rather the secular character
of a political gathering than the seriousness and
dignity of a church of Christ. Especially should the reception,
the discipline, the exclusion of a member, or the
election of a deacon or a pastor be an act of solemnity,
and, as far as possible, be done by the whole body.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s5" class="tdc">SECTION V.</h3>

<p class="tdc">ADMINISTRATION OF THE ORDINANCES.</p>

<p>The nature of the ordinances, as well as the obligation
of them, should be often and carefully explained to the
<span class="pagenum" id="p70">[p.&nbsp;70]</span>
people. This is the more necessary, since in the popular
mind superstitious ideas so largely enter into the conception
of them. In doing this, several different methods
have been adopted. Some have a preparatory lecture
in the course of the week preceding the administration:
others preach on the subject either on the previous Lord&rsquo;s
Day or just before the ordinance; and others depend
mainly on addresses on the occasion. Whatever be the
method, instruction should be carefully given, that true
views of the ordinances may prevail. For want of this
many church members never derive much benefit from
these sacred institutions, while some, doubtless, are
injured by them.</p>

<p>The principles respecting the ordinances which we, as
distinguished from other denominations, hold as biblical
should not be ignored or kept in the background. The
restoration of these Divine symbols to their primitive
significance and form is a matter of the highest moment,
and the pastor who is silent neglects duty. So far as
my observation extends, the spiritual success which
has attended the Baptists has always been connected
with their fidelity to the mission God has given in respect
to His truth concerning the church and the ordinances.
The most signal manifestations of the Spirit in our
churches, whether at home or abroad, have been made
where the great principles Christ has committed to us
have been most faithfully proclaimed. But in presenting
these controverted subjects, statements should always
be made with care. Whatever the provocation, we should
be careful to maintain a Christian spirit and uniform courtesy;
to be just and candid to those who differ; and to
avoid all imputation of evil motives. Indeed, it is usually
better to avoid the controversial form in presenting the
biblical view of the ordinances, especially at the time of
<span class="pagenum" id="p71">[p.&nbsp;71]</span>
administration; but if controversy is necessary, let it
rather be presented in sermons on other occasions. A
distinct course of sermons on the ordinances, carefully
prepared, is sometimes of great value for the instruction
of the church and the diffusion of right views in the
community.</p>

<p class="cgap">I. <span class="smcap">Administration of Baptism.</span></p>

<p>As the act is a symbol, the correctness of its form is
essential to the representation of the truth symbolized.
The greatest care, therefore, should be used to bring out
distinctly the symbol and fix all thought on that; any
defect in the administration which mars the symbol is to
be deprecated. The vital spiritual fact of regeneration,
or a death to sin and the rising to a new life in Christ,
is most vividly set forth before men by the impressiveness
of the symbol when properly rendered.</p>

<p>Here I suggest: 1.&nbsp;Care should be taken that all necessary
arrangements be made for the ordinance, in the
preparation for the place for the baptism, and the appointment
of judicious committees to attend the candidates.
This should be done in ample season, so that there be no
haste or confusion at the administration. The pastor
should be promptly prepared for the service, using
garments appropriate to baptizing, so as to be undisturbed
by the water. 2.&nbsp;In administering, be deliberate in
movement, leading the candidate slowly into the water
with the solemnity becoming so holy an ordinance. Special
care should be taken that the water be of such depth
as to make immersion easy and effective. Pronounce
the formula reverently, then immerse, taking care that
the whole person is covered. Beyond the formula, it is
often best to say nothing during the administration; the
ordinance itself is speaking to the conscience and the
<span class="pagenum" id="p72">[p.&nbsp;72]</span>
heart in a voice more eloquent and impressive than
human speech. 3.&nbsp;Above all, as you pray for wisdom
and power in the right use of <i>words</i> to set forth regeneration
by the sermon, so ask for wisdom and power in the
use of the <i>symbol</i> to set forth that vital truth in the ordinance,
and that Divine Helper whose presence you feel
in the pulpit will be equally present with you in the
baptismal act.</p>

<p class="cgap">II. <span class="smcap">Administration of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</span></p>

<p>In some churches it is customary to preach what is
termed &ldquo;an action sermon,&rdquo; designed to bring vividly
before the mind, just previous to the Supper, the events
connected with the sufferings and death of our Lord; and
it often proves a service of great power and value. With
us the ordinance is more commonly preceded by a simple
address designed to fix thought upon the great event
symbolized. Whatever the method adopted, all subjects
should be excluded which may divert the mind from the
one great thought of the occasion. The Lord&rsquo;s Table,
therefore, is not the place to bring up items of business,
or to reprove the church for special derelictions in duty,
or even to consider plans for church work. The pastor is
often tempted to use it for such purposes, because then
the members are more generally together and are alone.
But I think it is rarely done without loss, for in this
sacred service the Lord designed that the thoughts of
every soul should center on Him.</p>

<p>The necessary acts in their order are these: 1.&nbsp;Take the
bread, give thanks, break, give to the disciples, pronouncing
the words of institution. 2.&nbsp;Take the cup, pouring
the wine, give thanks, give to the disciples, pronouncing
the words of institution. The service is usually closed
with singing, but whether it was originally a part of the
<span class="pagenum" id="p73">[p.&nbsp;73]</span>
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, or only one of the hymns prescribed in
the Passover service, we have no means of determining.
The question is not important, but a closing hymn is certainly
appropriate, and it is better to observe the custom.
Observe the scriptural order of the acts carefully, for any
deviation will divert attention and is always painful. In
prayer avoid forms of expression that may convey false
ideas of the ordinances. Thus, we sometimes hear:
&ldquo;Bless so much of this bread,&rdquo; or &ldquo;so much of this
wine,&rdquo; &ldquo;as may be used,&rdquo; as if blessing made a change
in the elements, and the administrator feared too much
would be changed and the blessed elements might thus
be wasted. Such phrases, which have come down from
the ages of superstition, are adapted to foster among the
people false ideas of the ordinance. Do not talk much
during the administration but leave silent moments in
which each heart may commune with itself and with
Christ. Too much talking is the common fault. When
God is speaking through the symbol, let man keep silence.
This will be the more obvious if we remember that the
ordinance consists of two essential parts&mdash;the presentation
of the symbols of Christ&rsquo;s body and blood by the
administration, and the act of partaking as the symbol
of an inward act of faith on the part of the partaker.
If the attention, therefore, is held by remarks of the
administrator, the value of the ordinance may be lost to
the participant from lack of opportunity for silent communion
between his soul and Christ. Above all, enter
yourself as fully as possible into the great idea of the
ordinance, and use all means to fix thought on that to
the exclusion of all else. Rightly administered, the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper is one of the mightiest forces God has
given to inspire and purify the heart and elevate the life
of the church.</p>

<h3 id="s6" class="tdc">SECTION VI.</h3>

<p class="tdc">THE PASTOR AND THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL.</p>

<p>No pastor can be permanently successful if not in sympathy
with the young. He must be the pastor of the
children, accessible and attractive to youth, and must
give a cordial recognition and a kindly word as he meets
them. As an aid in this, make a register of their names
and a careful study of their faces, so as readily to recognize
them; and carry with you cards with Scripture mottoes
or other little souvenirs of a pastor&rsquo;s love and interest
to leave with them. The most successful ministers of the
present age are, as a rule, active Sunday-school workers.
Of several eminent pastors it was written some years ago:
&ldquo;The venerable Dr. Tyng, as is well known, attributes his
great success largely to his long-continued and unwearied
personal attention to his Sunday-school. He is never absent
from his home school. Rev. S.&nbsp;H. Tyng, Jr., uniformly
conducts the closing exercises of his home school, and also
the Friday-evening meetings of the teachers of all his four
schools, thus by indirection reaching the twelve hundred
children who in turn are taught by these teachers. Dr.
Howard Crosby takes up the lesson on Wednesday evening,
and preaches regularly to the children on Sunday
afternoons. Dr. Richard Newton, who has an almost
world-wide reputation as a children&rsquo;s preacher, takes up
the Sunday-school lesson at his weekly service, attends
his teachers&rsquo; meeting, and preaches regularly to the children
of the parish. Dr. John Hall goes each Sunday
morning into his home school and believing in &lsquo;hand-shaking
as a means of grace,&rsquo; takes each teacher and
scholar cordially by the hand. He lectures each Wednesday
evening on the Sunday-school lesson to a well-filled
<span class="pagenum" id="p75">[p.&nbsp;75]</span>
church, the audience having long since outgrown
the lecture-room. He conducts in person a monthly
review in his home school, questioning each class on the
lessons of the preceding month. He presides at the
monthly or bi-monthly sociable of the teachers of his
four schools and conducts on Saturday afternoon a ladies&rsquo;
Bible class which the lecture-room is too small comfortably
to hold.&rdquo; These are, indeed, rare men, but they show
the wonderful power that pastors may wield by sympathy
with the young, and by wisely-directed Bible study among
them. Indeed, the preparation of a Sunday-school sermon,
by compelling simplicity of statement and aptness
of illustration, is a valuable discipline for the preparation
of ordinary services.</p>

<p><i>Hints.</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;In public address or prayer let your appreciation
of the Sunday-school as a sphere of church work
and religious power be always manifest. Make it prominent
among the subjects of prayer both in the pulpit and
in the prayer-room. Exhort and instruct the church respecting
the necessity of securing for it cheerful, attractive
rooms and an ample apparatus in music, library, papers,
maps, etc. The interest and liberality of a congregation
in this depend greatly on the interest manifested in the
pulpit. 2.&nbsp;Use careful effort to form the adult members
of the congregation into Bible classes, and thus connect
them personally with the school. This can be done to a
much larger extent than is supposed, and the results are
of the highest value. It enlarges the biblical knowledge
and enriches the experience of the adult part of the
church. It brings to the school the moral support and
influence of this class. It is a means of holding the
young as they become men and women and preventing
their abandonment of the school as having become too
old for it. And it secures a permanent, living sympathy
<span class="pagenum" id="p76">[p.&nbsp;76]</span>
between the church and the school, thus avoiding that
isolation of the school which, in many instances, makes
it practically a separate interest outside of the church
rather than within it. 3.&nbsp;The pastor should let his presence
and personal influence be constantly felt in the
school; but if he have two sermons on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, he
should neither superintend it nor, if possible to avoid,
consent to take a class in it. It will exhaust him often
before the second sermon, and in the end may destroy his
nervous power. But he should be often present in the
school, talk to it occasionally, and make the personal
acquaintance of teachers and scholars, moving among
them as a friend and helper. 4.&nbsp;The pastor should, if
possible, meet the teachers weekly for instruction and
counsel, carefully studying with them the lesson for the
Lord&rsquo;s Day. The teachers&rsquo; meeting will afford opportunity
for the consideration, not of the lesson only, but
also of all the interests of the school. As a preparation
for this he should make himself familiar with the best
methods of Sunday-school work, that he may wisely inspire
and direct improvement. Or if it be thought that
the helps for the study of the lesson given in papers accessible
to the teachers are sufficient, the pastor&rsquo;s instruction
in the teachers&rsquo; meeting might take a wider range,
embracing courses of lectures on the Christian Evidences,
the Introduction to the Books of the Bible, the Scripture
Doctrines, Sacred Geography, and kindred subjects. In
this case the sphere of the meeting might be enlarged,
making it also a normal class, in which the more advanced
scholars, as well as the teachers, might be prepared for the
teacher&rsquo;s work. 5.&nbsp;Great care is to be exercised respecting
the books introduced into the library; for, while much
advance has been made in the style and adaptation of
books for the young, there are many which are not merely
<span class="pagenum" id="p77">[p.&nbsp;77]</span>
trashy but are positively pernicious. The Sunday-school
library is an instrument of great power in forming the
tastes, the opinions, and the habits of the people, and it
is of the utmost moment that the books be pure in doctrine
and healthful in moral and religious tone. 6.&nbsp;The
Sunday-school concert, in which the exercises are prepared
chiefly by the school itself, will be of great value
if wisely conducted; but care is needed to exclude exercises
introduced for sensational effect which may not befit
the Lord&rsquo;s Day. Indeed, it is all-important that the exercise
should not be degraded into a mere exhibition, awakening
on the part of teachers and scholars only a desire
to produce a popular sensation and draw the crowd, and
on the part of the people a desire to be amused. The
devotional spirit should always be dominant. But in addition
to such exercises, it will be profitable to preach a
sermon statedly&mdash;once a month, or at least once in three
months&mdash;expressly to the Sunday-school, adapting the
whole service to the young. It brings the pastor and
school together publicly and directly and recognizes the
relation of the pastor to it as its chief instructor and
guide. But in the sermon, as in every Sunday-school
address, he should be careful that in attempting to be simple
he does not become childish; the former is necessary
to success, the latter is a common and fatal mistake.</p>

<p>Finally, the hearty co-operation and sympathy, above
suggested, of pastor and people with the school will ordinarily
avert all difficulty on the question of the relation
of the Sunday-school to the church; for any school,
whether home or mission, which finds itself thus enclosed
within the living sympathies of the church will instinctively
recognize its position as belonging to the church and
under its watch-care and guidance. Nor will the other
evil, so widespread and unfortunate, of the non-attendance
<span class="pagenum" id="p78">[p.&nbsp;78]</span>
of the school on public worship be likely to be experienced;
for the scholars, won by the pastor&rsquo;s personal interest
in them, will be attracted to him and to his ministrations
in the pulpit.</p>

<h3 id="s7" class="tdc">SECTION VII.</h3>

<p class="tdc">PASTORAL VISITATION.</p>

<p>The care of souls is the radical idea of the pastor&rsquo;s
office. He is a shepherd to whom a flock has been committed
to guide, to feed, to defend; and the Divine command
enjoins: &ldquo;Take heed to <i>all</i> the flock, over the which
the Holy Ghost hath made you overseers&rdquo; (Acts xx.&nbsp;28).
He is to be the personal religious guide, the confidential
Christian friend, of his charge. Our Lord, in His description
of the Good Shepherd, said: &ldquo;The sheep hear His
voice; and He calleth His own sheep by name, and leadeth
them out. And when He putteth forth His own sheep,
He goeth before them, and the sheep follow Him; for they
know His voice&rdquo; (John x.&nbsp;3, 4). Each member of his
flock is a soul entrusted to his care by the Lord; and if
true to his trust, he is one of those who &ldquo;watch for souls
as they that must give account.&rdquo; Paul, when in Ephesus,
taught not only publicly, but &ldquo;from house to house;&rdquo; and
in his farewell charge to the elders of that city he said:
&ldquo;Watch, and remember that, by the space of three years,
I ceased not to warn every man night and day with tears&rdquo;
(Acts xx.&nbsp;31). Dr. Cuyler, one of the busiest and most
effective pastors in Brooklyn, says: &ldquo;Young brethren, aim
from the start to be thorough pastors. During the week
go to those whom you expect to come to you on the Lord&rsquo;s
Day. In the morning of each day study books; in the
<span class="pagenum" id="p79">[p.&nbsp;79]</span>
afternoon study door-plates and <i>human nature.</i> Your
people will give you material for your best practical sermons.
After an effective Sunday work go around among
your flock, as Napoleon rode over the field after a battle&mdash;to
see where the shot struck and who were among the
wounded.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Taylor, of the Broadway Tabernacle, New York,
addressing theological students, says: &ldquo;You will make a
great mistake if you undervalue the visitation of your
people. The pulpit is your throne, no doubt; but then a
throne is stable as it rests on the affections of the people,
and to get their affections you must visit them in their
dwellings. I used to look upon my visitation as a dreadful
drudgery, but it has now become my joy, so that whenever
I am tempted to despond I sally forth to visit my
flock; and as I look back upon those early years in which
I had no such gladness, I am earnestly desirous to save
you from blundering as I did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. John Hall, of New York, speaking to a similar
audience, said: &ldquo;Pains should be taken that nothing
prevents your making pastoral visits. It is very necessary
for you to know the people in their homes, and for
the people to know you. The little children and the
young people should know you. The men should know
you. It is only in this way that you can get a distinct
idea of the wants of your people, and so be enabled to
adapt your preaching to them. Do not begrudge the
time thus spent. In freely conversing with humble
people you will get side-lights, or particular testimony,
that will make you a stronger man and a better minister
for many a day to come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bishop Simpson, alluding to the timidity often felt by
young men in regard to pastoral visitation, gives this bit
of experience: &ldquo;I had much of this timidity when I
<span class="pagenum" id="p80">[p.&nbsp;80]</span>
entered the ministry. The palms of my hands sometimes
burned at the very thought of going out to visit.
But I felt I must go; the church bade me go; I had
promised God I would go; and as the soldier in the
army walks forward timidly, yet determinedly, into the
thickest of the fight, so I went in my Master&rsquo;s name.
If I could, I took with me some experienced Christian
friend. I spoke to the people kindly; drew out of them
their religious condition and experience; found many
a wandering one and tried to comfort many a sorrowing
heart. Such visits made me better, taught me to feel for
the people, and to break for them the bread of life with
more fitness. In a revival which followed, out of nearly
three hundred who came to the altar for prayer there
were very few with whom I had not previously conversed,
and I knew how to enter into their sympathies and to
point them to the Lamb of God.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The late eminent President Francis Wayland, in closing
an earnest plea to pastors on this subject, said: &ldquo;If, at last,
it be said that all this is beneath the dignity of our profession,
and that we cannot expect an educated man to
spend his time in visiting mechanics in their shops and
in sitting down with women engaged in their domestic
labor to converse with them on the subject of religion,
to this objection I have no reply to offer. Let the objector
present his case in its full force to Him who, on His journey
to Galilee, &lsquo;sat thus on the well&rsquo; and held a memorable
conversation with a woman of Samaria.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Pastoral visitation, therefore&mdash;this personal care of
souls&mdash;is an essential part of the pastor&rsquo;s work; and
no minister meets the responsibilities of the sacred
office who neglects direct individual religious contact
with his flock. For the performance of this duty, however,
it is obvious no rules of universal application can
<span class="pagenum" id="p81">[p.&nbsp;81]</span>
be given. Men differ in their characteristics and modes
of working, and each pastor will ordinarily succeed best
with his own method. Churches differ in their circumstances
and modes of life, and a method adapted to one
field may not be at all feasible in another. The main
points here to be kept in view are that the pastor in
some way come into personal religious relations with
his flock, and that this be done by a fixed plan. The
suggestions made, therefore, will be of only a general
character, and will relate to the limits of this duty,
the method of performing it, and the advantages of
its faithful discharge.</p>

<p class="cgap">I. <span class="smcap">Its Limits.</span></p>

<p>In the pastor&rsquo;s plan of work, how large a place should
be given to pastoral visitation?</p>

<p>The pulpit, without doubt, has the highest claim.
The pastor is there surrounded by his whole flock, and
stands forth before the world as God&rsquo;s ambassador, the
accredited expositor and defender of the Gospel. No
private duty can rise to the dignity and responsibility of
this great public work, and no plea of pastoral exigencies
or pastoral usefulness can excuse an habitual neglect of
thorough preparation for the sacred desk. This is primary
and essential.</p>

<p>But in the pastor&rsquo;s plan he should also aim to secure
the visitation of every family and, as far as possible,
every person in his congregation. In most churches
this could be done at least as often as once a year; in
some, doubtless, more frequently than this. By employing
system, laying out the work carefully, and rigidly
devoting fixed seasons for its prosecution, a large congregation
can be readily visited. Suppose that, in addition
to those made in cases of sickness and special
<span class="pagenum" id="p82">[p.&nbsp;82]</span>
urgency, six visits in regular course are made every
week, even this, small as the number is, in half a year
would reach more than a hundred and fifty families&mdash;a
number above the average of households in our congregations.
For this two or three afternoons each week
would ordinarily be ample, and the pastor, by thus
placing himself in living sympathy with the life of his
people, would gain far more than that for his study by
the increased facility with which his sermons would be
prepared and their individual adaptation to the needs
of the congregation. Dr. John Hall says: &ldquo;I think a
minister in good health, and doing his work easily and
naturally, should visit some on at least five days in the
week. I have done that for months together.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A few
hours a day spent in visiting gives exercise, bodily, intellectual,
and moral. One studies better for it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There are, indeed, positions in the ministry in which,
from the extent of the church and the pressure of outside
duties, the pastor can do little in this department
beyond the visitation of the sick and cases of special
religious perplexity. But these instances are rare and
exceptional, and in such churches provision ought
always to be made to supply the lack of pastoral visitation
either by an assistant to the pastor, devoted to this
work, or by delegating it to competent committees charged
with its accomplishment. When the Baptist Tabernacle
of New York, then worshipping in Mulberry street,
numbered over a thousand members, widely scattered
over that large city, the late venerated Deacon William
Colgate organized a plan by which the congregation was
divided into convenient districts, each placed under the
care of a competent brother, and it long proved a most
effective organization for church watch-care and visitation.</p>

<p>There is here a further inquiry: Does the pastor&rsquo;s duty
<span class="pagenum" id="p83">[p.&nbsp;83]</span>
of visitation extend beyond the limits of his own congregation?
The answer to this must depend on the number
of his flock, his special aptitudes, and the amount of his
own strength. The Lord does not require impossibilities.
But whoever carefully considers that even in the rural
districts of New York more than one-half the population
attend no evangelical church, I think, will anxiously ask
how this mass of neglecters of the Gospel shall be reached;
and the pastor who looks down Sunday after Sunday on
a half-filled church may well inquire whether it might
not be crowded if, instead of waiting for these careless
souls to come to him, he should go to them and carry
the message of the Gospel, with the urgencies of an
earnest, prayerful heart, into the bosom of their families.
Or if this is not possible for him, ought he not to train
and organize Christian workers in his church to make
this aggressive movement on the mass of indifferentism
around him? The inspiring and organizing of such
aggressive Christian labor as faithful visitation from
house to house are among the most important duties of
the pastor, and no form of Christian activity is more
fruitful in blessed results, both in the higher Christian
development of the visitors and in the awakening and
conversion of those who are visited.</p>

<p class="cgap">II. <span class="smcap">The Method.</span></p>

<p>Here no single method can be suggested that will be
adapted to all positions in the ministry, but the following
general views may be considered.</p>

<p>The pastor&rsquo;s visits should be distinctly understood as
designed for religious conversation. There are other
occasions for visits of mere courtesy and personal friendship,
but here his object is to place himself in religious
contact with his people&mdash;to learn their experiences, to
<span class="pagenum" id="p84">[p.&nbsp;84]</span>
remove their perplexities, to comfort their sorrows, to
stimulate their religious activities&mdash;and thus, as one
entrusted with the care of souls, to help them heavenward.
The minister who passes from house to house
conversing only on topics of mere secular interest
neglects the great business of his life, and in the eye
of the Master fails in the care of souls committed to his
charge.</p>

<p>The visit should be religious, but it ought to be
divested as far as possible of stiffness, formality, sameness.
A sour visage and a formal style are not necessary
to religious conversation. The pastor comes as a Christian
friend deeply, tenderly interested in the religious
welfare of the family, and while dealing with their souls
in all fidelity, he should use a natural, genial, winning
manner such as to put them at ease and invite their
confidence. He is to study character, and to employ his
utmost tact and judgment in adapting his words to those
addressed. Some pastors have a few stereotyped questions
and exhortations which recur in every visit. A process
so stiff and unnatural lacks all moral power; it is soon
felt to be mere formal professionalism. No duty is more
delicate or tasks more fully the minister&rsquo;s resources than
the successful management of a pastoral visit, so as to
leave a strong religious impression, and yet secure from
old and young a hearty welcome for its repetition.</p>

<p>In visitation the pastor should overlook none. Domestics
and children, as well as the heads of the family, should
share his attention and be made to feel that he cares for
their souls. Nor should any family or person be overlooked
or passed by, but the visit should be strictly impartial,
made alike to the rich and the poor, the converted
and the unconverted. For this reason, it is better to have
a regular course in visitation. Then all know that there
<span class="pagenum" id="p85">[p.&nbsp;85]</span>
is no favoritism, and in their turn, they will alike share
the regards of their pastor.</p>

<p>Ordinarily, the visit should be short. Circumstances
will necessarily to some extent control this, but long visits
almost inevitably lead to the introduction of secular
topics and weaken or destroy the religious impression.
Thoughtless persons will often importune the pastor for
a half-day visit, to be followed by a festal dinner or supper.
But let him beware of yielding to such importunities;
it is fatal to his work in the study, and fatal to the
religious force of the visit. No earnest minister will waste
his time and powers in the gossip of such a visit. As a
rule, a brief visit&mdash;genial, but to the point&mdash;followed, when
practicable, by a brief prayer specifically bearing the individual
needs of the household before the Throne, is the
most effective, and it leaves time to visit the whole congregation
without distracting from thorough pulpit preparation.</p>

<p>A pastoral visit should be confidential. No minister
has the right to invite disclosures of the religious state
of his people in the privacy of their families, and then
go forth to retail these conversations through the community.
It is the violation of a sacred trust. Many a pastor
has thus destroyed his influence and barred against
himself access to the confidence of his people. If he
would be trusted as the confidential adviser and friend
of his charge, let him be true to the trusts reposed in
him in these visits.</p>

<p>Above all, the pastor must remember the injunction,
&ldquo;Instant in season, out of season.&rdquo; He should make the
most of opportunities. In the store, the office, and the
shop, on the farm, the roadside, and the car&mdash;everywhere&mdash;he
is to seek to lead men to Christ. Wisely, indeed, he
will observe the proprieties of time and place, but he
<span class="pagenum" id="p86">[p.&nbsp;86]</span>
should neglect no real opportunity of conversing on vital
personal religion. The care of souls is his life-work, his
solemn charge, and concern for their salvation ought continually
to reveal itself in his conversation. Especially
must he seize on opportunities to speak the earnest, kindly
word to the unconverted. Ordinarily, this is better done
when alone with them, as they are then more accessible,
and the appeal comes with greater power. The lack of
this personal dealing with souls is one of the saddest defects
than can mar the life of a minister.</p>

<p class="cgap">III. <span class="smcap">The Advantages.</span></p>

<p>The personal religious growth of the pastor is greatly
aided by this direct contact with the souls of his charge.
In a minister&rsquo;s life the danger is that he may degenerate
into mere professionalism. He may come to study God&rsquo;s
Word and its great truths, not with personal application,
but with respect only to the preparation of his sermons
and their application to the people. He may lose a vivid
consciousness of his personal relations to God and read
and think and pray with reference only to others. Many
a pastor actually advancing in general knowledge of the
Bible and in professional power as to the composition
and delivery and mental richness of his sermons is,
after all, only retrograding in his inner personal life as a
Christian.</p>

<p>But the direct contact with individual souls in pastoral
visitation brings religion before him less as a theory,
more as a living, personal reality. He deals here with
religion in the concrete rather than the abstract. He is
the witness of its actual power to comfort in sorrow, to
strengthen in temptation, to guide in perplexity, to triumph
in danger, and his own soul thus enters into a
more full realization of it as a living fact. How often
<span class="pagenum" id="p87">[p.&nbsp;87]</span>
when seeking to guide another to Christ does he himself
find new access to Him, or when administering consolation
to a dejected, afflicted spirit do new courage and
hope spring up in his own heart! It develops within
him broader, purer sympathies and makes him a truer,
nobler Christian.</p>

<p>Visitation also affords the best means of studying the
people in their actual life, their characters, opinions, temptations,
afflictions and sins. The successful preacher
must be a student of men, especially a student of his own
congregation. Many a recluse pastor wastes the greater
part of his force because his preaching lacks adaptation
and practicalness. His sermon, it may be, is faultless in
its rhetoric and logic and learning and orthodoxy, but
it fails to move the people, because it does not come
within the range of their experiences. It removes none
of their perplexities; it touches none of their special
sins; it discusses no questions vital in their life; it is not
Ithuriel&rsquo;s spear, to touch and expose the masked tempter
charming and deluding their ears. The preacher is not
in sympathy with the actual life of the congregation, and
the sermon, however abstractly true and beautiful, does
not move and bless them. It is with the actual life the
minister has to deal; and the study of it in all its manifold
phases, as developed under the power of sin and
grace, is essential to the highest power in the pulpit. An
old Divine used to say: &ldquo;The preacher has three books
to study&mdash;the Bible, himself, and the people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor should I omit to say here that pastoral visitation is
a mentally enriching process. In the study of life and
experience, as a pastor meets them in passing from house
to house, he is ever gaining new insight into character.
In these conversations, new vistas of truth open before
him, and from these visits he comes back to his study
<span class="pagenum" id="p88">[p.&nbsp;88]</span>
with new texts and subjects for sermons and new illustrations
of experience and doctrine.</p>

<p>These pastoral visits, moreover, establish personal religious
relations between the minister and the congregation,
and thus greatly add to their interest in his sermons.
They alter the standpoint of the hearer in reference to
the preacher. The man with whom you have wisely and
tenderly conversed on vital, personal religion cannot turn
a cold, critical ear toward you on the Lord&rsquo;s Day; nor
does he&mdash;what is equally fatal to spiritual benefit&mdash;listen
as a mere admirer of your pulpit performances. He has
a deeper feeling. He turns to you, not merely his critical
and intellectual, but his religious, nature, and the
words you speak, as the utterances of one sincerely seeking
his eternal welfare, come to him with a religious
power. This is, without doubt, the secret of many a
successful pastorate, even where there has not been the
aid of brilliant pulpit eloquence. The pastor has established
personal religious relations with his hearers, and to
them even his least elaborate sermons are clothed with
sacred power. Brilliant sermonizing may secure popularity,
but only this personal religious contact between
pastor and people secures confidence; and a pastor&rsquo;s real
power in producing spiritual, eternal results is dependent
on the religious confidence of the people in him.</p>

<p>These visits also enable him to meet many whom the
pulpit could never reach. In every community there are
the aged, requiring the supports of religion in their declining
life; the sick and sorrowing, craving the words of
Christian consolation and hope; and the careless, needing
the kindly invitation and warning. The pastor is
God&rsquo;s commissioned messenger to such, and in these personal
interviews he may adapt instruction, encouragement,
comfort, and admonition to each.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p89">[p.&nbsp;89]</span>
Finally, pastoral visitation is a chief means of blessing
and cementing the pastoral relation. Of late years pastorates
have become of short duration. Hardly is a minister
settled and fairly at work before the question of a
change begins to be agitated. May not the decline of
pastoral visitation, so faithfully done by many of our
fathers in the ministry, be in part an explanation of this?
The pastor&rsquo;s personal religious life is not brought into
contact with his people; as the result, their religious confidence
is not won, and his ministry is not in sympathy
with their needs. The only bond between them is the
pulpit; and when the novelty of his voice and manner
and modes of thought has passed away, they are tired
of him and seek a change.</p>

<p>Besides, when the pastor is not faithful to the souls of
his people in private, they instinctively feel that he is not
sincere&mdash;at least, not thoroughly in earnest&mdash;in his public
preaching. On the Lord&rsquo;s Day he comes before them proclaiming
the most solemn truths and pressing these truths
with the strongest urgency, but in the week, he meets
them and has no words of kindly invitation and warning.
He solemnly warns the impenitent from the pulpit
of their imminent peril of everlasting burnings but meets
them in their homes or on the street, perhaps year after
year, without one word expressive of his interest for their
eternal welfare. Such inconsistency makes religious confidence
impossible, and there is no adequate bond to bind
pastor and people together.</p>

<p>But the relation of pastor and people, as God ordained
it, is most sacred and enduring. Charged with the care
of souls, he is to move among his flock as their spiritual
guide and friend. The confessional, terrible as its power
for evil is, was after all in its origin only a perversion of
the pastoral institution, based on a real and universal
<span class="pagenum" id="p90">[p.&nbsp;90]</span>
need&mdash;the longing of troubled souls for guidance, help in
getting back to God. This need the pastor must meet
as the confidential counsellor and helper of the individual
members of his flock; and if true to this sacred
trust, his resources of power are ever increasing, and new
bonds of sympathy hold him more firmly year by year
in the hearts of his church.</p>

<p class="cgap">IV. <span class="smcap">Visitation of the Sick.</span></p>

<p>This is one of the most responsible and difficult duties
of the pastor, for it often devolves on him the spiritual
guidance of souls on the verge of eternity, when what is
said must be said at once and words fitly spoken are of
supreme moment. I have, therefore, reserved this subject
for special suggestions.</p>

<p>1. The people should be instructed to notify the pastor
when cases of sickness occur, for he is often blamed for
neglect in visiting the sick when in fact he did not know
of the sickness. He should make public request, therefore,
that notice be sent to him of such cases, with the fullest
assurance of readiness on his part to respond to such a
call at all hours and in all places. Of course, in cases of
known sickness among his own people, a pastor will not
wait to be invited, but will call as an understood part of
his pastoral duty.</p>

<p>2. It is always prudent to visit the sick in a rested
rather than wearied state of body, and with a full rather
than an empty stomach; the liability to contract disease
is thereby lessened. In contagious diseases a medical
adviser should be consulted as to the best means of avoiding
danger, and disinfectants should be carefully used
after the visit to avoid endangering others. Whether in
such cases it is duty to visit no rule can be given; the
decision must be left to the convictions of the pastor
<span class="pagenum" id="p91">[p.&nbsp;91]</span>
and the relations and circumstances of each. The words
of Van Oosterzee, in his <i>Practical Theology,</i> deserve here,
however, careful consideration: &ldquo;The negative answer,
favored by the theory and practice of some, finds an apparent
justification in the natural desire for self-preservation
and in the teacher&rsquo;s relation to his own family. In
opposition to this, however, stands the consideration that
even the Christian is bound to lay down his life for the
brethren, how much more the shepherd of the sheep!
and that, in this sphere also, loss of life in the service
of the Lord is the way to the preservation of life.
Without doubt, fulfilment of duty in this case may cost
a painful sacrifice.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Nevertheless, the Lord and his
congregation have unquestionably the right to demand
that duty take precedence of everything; as accordingly
Luther, in 1527, during the prevalence of the plague,
remained with Pomeranus and two deacons at Wittenberg,
and in this way answers the question formally
raised by him in his tractate, &lsquo;Whether we may flee
before death?&rsquo; When, in 1574, the question here put
was expressly deliberated at the Synod of Dort, the
answer was given, &lsquo;that they should go, being called,
and even uncalled, inasmuch as they know that there
will be need of them.&rsquo; With what right shall the physician
of souls withdraw from a task from which even
the unbelieving medical man does not too greatly
shrink?&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The risk incurred on that occasion finds
its abundant compensation in the gratitude of the flock,
the approval of our own conscience, and the ever-renewed
experience that the Lord supports His servants in
this school of exercise also, and not seldom manifestly
preserves them. Of course, belief in His power and faithfulness
can release no one from the duty of taking those
measures of precaution prescribed under such circumstances
<span class="pagenum" id="p92">[p.&nbsp;92]</span>
by experience and science.&rdquo; The question is
sometimes one of the most difficult in a pastor&rsquo;s life,
and without doubt there is much danger that he may
take counsel of timidity rather than of that faith which
becomes a servant of God.</p>

<p>3. Careful preparation should be made for such visits
by previous study and prayer. In this he is to seek a
spiritual frame of mind, to select and familiarize Scripture
passages adapted to the different spiritual conditions
and needs of the sick, to elaborate fitting trains of
thought, and to acquire brief, simple, and apt illustrations
of the way of salvation, thus fitting himself for the different
phases of spiritual condition in the sick. I hardly
need add that at the basis, as underlying all preparation,
there must be a sound judgment and a heart in genuine
sympathy with the afflicted, so that the pastor comes into
the sick-chamber as a wise and sympathizing friend and
is felt as such.</p>

<p>4. In manner it is important to be self-possessed and
natural, sympathetic and cheerful, putting the sick at
ease and inspiring confidence. The voice should be
tender and subdued, but not falsely keyed and whining.
The visit, except in unusual circumstances, should be
brief. A neglect of these things will destroy the advantage
of the interview, and in some cases will exclude the
pastor from the sick.</p>

<p>5. In regard to conversation with the sick, no fixed
rules can be given, since the cases present phases so
varied; the good sense and tact of the pastor will suggest
the best method in each case. Plainly, the matter
of first moment is a clear, thorough, and accurate understanding
of the spiritual condition of the patient, for
without this the pastor&rsquo;s words may be misdirected, or
may even be wholly misleading. He may administer
<span class="pagenum" id="p93">[p.&nbsp;93]</span>
consolation where the heart is in rebellion against God
and needs rather kindly warning, or he may encourage
hope where the heart is self-deceived, and God has spoken
only condemnation. An interview alone, if it can be
arranged, will sometimes secure from the sick a more full
disclosure of the heart, and will enable the pastor to
speak with greater directness and freedom. If the sick
person is a Christian, the question then becomes, Is he
at peace, submissively, restfully trusting all in God&rsquo;s
hand? If not, ascertain what is preventing this, and if
possible, help the soul back to God. If he is not a Christian,
seek to know what prevents him from becoming one,
and lead him if possible to Christ. But use a careful discrimination,
distinguishing clearly between the true and
false in religious experience, and avoid mere loose
exhortations to come to Christ, which leave unexplained
what Christ is, and what He has done, and what it is to
come to Him. In all cases, whether to saint or sinner,
Christ is to be presented in His fulness of grace and
power as the one Hope and the one Helper for the humble,
penitent soul, and the thought of the sick is to be
lifted and turned to Him as a living, present Savior and
an almighty Friend.</p>

<p>6. Prayer, when practicable, should always be offered
in the sick-room. In severe illness it is sometimes advisable
to do nothing more than offer prayer, and in such a
case, where the sufferer may be near eternity, how fitting
and weighty ought to be these words of petition! How
tender, earnest, direct, should be the prayer, bearing the
case with all its priceless interests into the presence of
God! Vinet strikingly says: &ldquo;Expect much from prayer&mdash;I
mean not only from its power with God, but from its
immediate effects on the sick. We may say everything
in prayer; under the form of prayer we may make everything
<span class="pagenum" id="p94">[p.&nbsp;94]</span>
acceptable; with it we may make hearts the most
firmly closed open themselves to us. There is a true
<i>charm</i> in prayer; and this charm has also its effect on us,
whom it renders more confident, more gentle, more
patient, and whom it puts into affecting fellowship with
the sick man, whoever he may be, by making God present
to us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>These seasons of affliction furnish a pastor the surest
access to the homes and hearts of his flock; and rightly
improved they greatly add, not only to his pastoral usefulness,
but also to his personal hold on the affection and
confidence of the families of his charge. Neglect of the
sick and sorrowing on the part of a pastor, or a heartless,
perfunctory manner in performing his duties to them, violates
the most sacred obligations, and is justly felt alike
by the religious and the irreligious as a reproach to him:
it must in the end destroy the power of his work in the
pulpit. He should use great care, therefore, to keep himself
informed as to the sick and afflicted, to visit them
promptly and frequently, and to come to their homes, in
the spirit of his Master, with the tender, earnest sympathy
of a Christian friend, and with the rich resources for Christian
help and consolation with which he is entrusted by
God as a minister of the Gospel.</p>

<p class="tdc">REVIVALS OF RELIGION.</p>

<p>The history of Christianity is a history of revivals by
which the work of redemption has been advanced among
men; there is all reason to suppose that it will be so to
the end. Men dream of the Gospel advancing with even,
<span class="pagenum" id="p95">[p.&nbsp;95]</span>
steady pace to its triumph, without the vicissitudes of decline
and revival but the thought finds ground neither in the
Bible nor in church history. The great revivals in the
past have been epochs in which the Christian world has
risen to clearer apprehensions of Divine truth and a higher
elevation of Christian life. They have constituted the
Divine process by which the Gospel has burst through the
errors and sins of men and has found a more complete
development in the consciousness and life of the churches
of Christ.</p>

<p>No careful student of church history will undervalue
revivals of religion. By it no means follows that a
pastor is to seek success only, or chiefly, in these special
manifestations of spiritual power. For a revival ordinarily
supposes a previous declension, which it was the
design of the ministry to prevent; for they are given &ldquo;for
the perfecting of the saints, for the edifying of the body
of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. iv.&nbsp;12). Fidelity and wisdom in the
pastor may keep the spiritual forces in a church so inspired
and organized that its life will not decline, but develop
and strengthen, and its condition consequently be
one of continual growth and progress. Such is the fact
in Mr. Spurgeon&rsquo;s church. As one mingles in its assemblies
and observes its manifold and thoroughly organized
activities, the preaching and devotion, the spirit and life,
resemble what is seen in a powerful revival of religion.
The Holy Spirit is continually present, and there is no
cessation in the work of conversion. Toward this ideal
a true pastor will be always working; and where it is
attained a revival will mean, not a recovery from declension,
but an acceleration in spiritual advancement and
a mightier display of the Spirit&rsquo;s power in the conversion
of men.</p>

<p>But in the ordinary manifestations of Christian life religious
<span class="pagenum" id="p96">[p.&nbsp;96]</span>
declension is often a marked and painful fact, and
the pastor should seek the best methods for promoting a
revival.</p>

<p>Here it is of primary moment to remember that a genuine
revival is the result of the presence of the Holy Spirit:
without Him there may be excitement, but there can be no
spiritual movement. It is &ldquo;not by might, nor by power,
but by My Spirit, saith the Lord&rdquo; (Zech. iv.&nbsp;6). A deep
sense of this is essential, and all thought and feeling
should be turned to the invocation of His presence; but
the Spirit works through human agencies and according
to the laws of the human mind. The use of appropriate
means, therefore, is also essential.</p>

<p>Here I suggest: 1.&nbsp;Christian life in the people will seldom
rise above the spiritual level of the pastor; it is,
therefore, of primary moment that the minister&rsquo;s own
soul be &ldquo;in the Spirit&rdquo;&mdash;humble, fervent, and believing.
Noise and zeal and declamation and management can be
no substitute for the Holy Spirit in the soul. 2.&nbsp;As a
revival of life in the church is ordinarily the condition of
an awakening among the unconverted, the preaching at
first should be specially adapted to search the experience
and life of Christians, and lead to increase in personal
holiness and personal activity. The church is &ldquo;the light
of the world&rdquo; (Matt. v.&nbsp;14), and the power of the Gospel
on the world depends on the clearness with which this
light shines. 3.&nbsp;Seek to promote faithful personal conversation
on the part of Christians with their unconverted
kindred and friends. It is sometimes useful to organize
committees to visit religiously from house to house in the
congregation. It is obvious, however, that great care should be
taken both as to the <i>personnel</i> of such committees and as
to the method of their work. 4.&nbsp;Meetings should be multiplied
as the interest manifested will justify. Continuous
<span class="pagenum" id="p97">[p.&nbsp;97]</span>
meetings concentrate attention on the subject of religion,
fix impressions which otherwise might be evanescent, and
lead to religious decision. The block may seem unaffected
by a single blow, but a succession of blows on the same
point cleaves it. 5.&nbsp;The mode of conducting special meetings
must be determined by the existing indications of the
Spirit and providence of God. If gifts abound in the church,
it is often better not to have additional preaching, but to
continue social meetings, taking care to give variety, in their
tone and form. If preaching is necessary, the question
whether an evangelist is to be sought, or help obtained
from neighboring pastors, or the pastor himself should
preach, must be determined by the circumstances. All
these methods have proved useful. If assistance is sought,
care should be used to secure a man of right spirit and
practical wisdom.</p>

<p>The question may arise: Ought a series of meetings to
be commenced when there is no special religious interest
apparent? I reply: It seems to me that certainly equal
reasons exist for the appointment of continuous meetings
to awaken interest in the subject of religion, as for the appointment
of such meetings to awaken interest in temperance,
politics, or science. The same mental law is invoked
in all such cases&mdash;viz., that <i>continuous</i> attention to a subject
causes the mind to become interested and absorbed in
it and rouses the will to act respecting it. Now, as the
Holy Spirit works in the soul, not contrary to the constitution
God has given to the mind, but in accordance with it,
the interest thus awakened by continuous attention to the
religion of Christ would seem to furnish the natural conditions
for the Spirit&rsquo;s work. And as the Gospel of Christ
is the most important subject to which the attention of
men can be called, there would seem to be the highest reason
for the application of this mental law by appointing
<span class="pagenum" id="p98">[p.&nbsp;98]</span>
continuous meetings in order to fix men&rsquo;s attention
upon it.</p>

<p>In protracted meetings, however, there are sometimes
serious evils, which a pastor should carefully avoid. Of
these I mention: 1.&nbsp;A mere man-made excitement, in
which the effort is rather to inflame the religious feelings
than to enlighten and strengthen religious conviction.
Such an appeal to the emotional, apart from the rational,
nature results ordinarily in a disastrous reaction in the
direction of indifferentism and skepticism. Many a field
has been burnt over by these <i>pseudo</i>-revivals, and they
constitute the most difficult fields for Christian labor, because
religion has thereby been put under contempt.
2.&nbsp;A protracted meeting entered on for secondary ends, as to
pay off a church debt or to strengthen the position of an
unpopular pastor. Where a revival is sought without dominant
regard to the glory of God and the salvation of souls,
the effort is a failure. 3.&nbsp;A tendency to dependence upon
protracted meetings to the disparagement of the ordinary
means of grace. Great care is needed to guard against
this, as it is destructive to the tone and effectiveness of
church-life. The pastor, in prayer and sermon, should be
careful to keep prominent before the people, not the revival
as the great hope of Christian life and progress, but
the right us of the usual, constant means of grace. Some
ministers habitually speak as if the work of God in conversion
and sanctification were restricted to seasons of
revivals, and the effect is pernicious. To avoid this false
reliance on special services, it is well not to appoint them
at any stated intervals, or to push them in any way into
special prominence. 4.&nbsp;In the reaction which occurs after
the extreme nervous tension of a protracted meeting, guard
against relapse in the converts. In the life of a plant the
period of greatest peril is when it is transferred from the
<span class="pagenum" id="p99">[p.&nbsp;99]</span>
hot-bed to the ground, for, missing the warmth and protection
of the bed, and exposed to the cold and storms of
the open field, it will inevitably droop and wither and die,
unless carefully tended. The most difficult and arduous
work of a pastor is after a revival in the care and instruction
of converts, when the unusual stimulus to Christian
activity is withdrawn; and it is just here that the evils
exist which are commonly charged on revivals and evangelists,
but which in reality result from remissness in the
pastor and church. The converts should be introduced at
once into the Sunday-school or Bible class, and should be
made personally acquainted, as far as possible, with the
members of the church. Where the number of converts
is large, the pastor might privately request some judicious
experienced members to give them special attention, quietly
handing to each a list of those thus specially commended
to his or her friendly notice and care. A place
and a work for each of the converts should also be sought;
this is very important to their comfort and development.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s9" class="tdc">SECTION IX.</h3>

<p class="tdc">CULTIVATION OF SOCIAL LIFE IN THE CHURCH.</p>

<p>The development of a true Christian life in the church
depends much on the social influences which, like an
atmosphere, pervade and envelop it. These, therefore,
the pastor should seek to inspire and control. As far as
possible, the membership should find their society within
the church&mdash;not in a spirit of clannish exclusiveness, but
on the principle that the higher bond of spiritual affinity,
which binds them as a church to one another and to Christ,
involves, as a natural consequence, the lower
<span class="pagenum" id="p100">[p.&nbsp;100]</span>
bond of social affinity, so that the church is the natural
sphere of the soul&rsquo;s activities, social as well as spiritual.
To make the social life of the church strong, healthful,
enriching, such as render it a magnet to attract other
souls, is of primary moment in a pastor&rsquo;s work. I suggest
two ways in which this may be done.</p>

<p>1. Personal effort to promote mutual acquaintance in
the congregation by introducing strangers, and by securing
for them those attentions which will naturally draw
them to the church as a home. See that they meet a
cordial welcome at the public meeting, and also socially
by the calling of members at their homes, and by extending
to them social courtesies and kindnesses. A
watchful pastor may do much to secure this by personal
suggestion.</p>

<p>2. Social gatherings in the church, in which the people
shall have opportunity for acquaintance and for the
exercise of the social feelings. These differ in plan.
(1.)&nbsp;They are sometimes purely social, in which the
object is conversation, music, and such forms of recreation
as may be innocent and healthful. The tact of the
pastor will here be required to give the right tone and
spirit to the gathering, to promote general acquaintance
and sociability, and to guard against doubtful forms of
amusement. (2.)&nbsp;They sometimes add to the social the
literary element, and a part of the time is occupied with
readings, recitations, essays, poems, and the discussion
of subjects in history, biography, general literature, and
science. These, when carefully managed, are often of
great value in advancing the general culture and intelligence,
and in calling out, especially in the young, talents
which would otherwise be undeveloped. The successful
working of such an organization of course presupposes
broad intelligence in the pastor and not a little careful
<span class="pagenum" id="p101">[p.&nbsp;101]</span>
thought and labor. (3.)&nbsp;Sometimes the object is not only
social and literary, but also missionary, and the exercises
consist in part of reports on missionary work, home and
foreign, correspondence with missionaries, and essays on
the lives of eminent missionary characters and topics
relating to the missionary enterprise. The organization
might also engage in different forms of actual mission
work, such as mission Sunday-schools, religious meetings
at destitute points, and personal labor, young men among
young men, young women among young women, to bring
them to church and otherwise help them in entering and
prosecuting a Christian life.</p>

<p>The social element is so mighty a force that no pastor
can afford to ignore it; nor should he imagine that it
will take care of itself, for, left unguided, it will almost
certainly take a false direction and destroy much of his
work. His true position is as its inspiring leader, thus
linking its power to those forces which shall ensure his
success.</p>

<p><i>Hints.</i>&mdash;1.&nbsp;The pastor, I think, should ordinarily hold
no official position in these organizations, but should
stand related to them simply as pastor, and as thus the
general head of all church organization; and he should
be felt not so much (if at all) in the assertion of his
authority as in the way of quiet suggestion and inspiration.
2.&nbsp;In all social life there will necessarily be different
social centers, caused by naturally differing social
affinities, and it is unwise to attempt to break this up.
But care should be taken that these social centers do not
take on the exclusiveness of cliques with party spirit
and jealousies, and that the aristocratic element does
not develop itself to the discomfort or exclusion of the
poorer classes. These tendencies, always present, should
be carefully held in check. 3.&nbsp;Every house of worship
<span class="pagenum" id="p102">[p.&nbsp;102]</span>
should have a church parlor, or some room which can
readily be converted into one. This should be furnished
attractively, and supplied with musical instruments, pictures,
and other means of culture. If a reading-room
and library can also be connected, it adds much value in
the increase of intelligence among the people. A church
will readily furnish funds for this purpose if properly
instructed; for parents, aside from the advantage they
personally derive from such an arrangement, will feel the
advantage to their families of a church social life so
strong and attractive as to draw and hold the children
to the associations of the church in preference to the
associations of the world.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s10" class="tdc">SECTION X.</h3>

<p class="tdc">THE PASTOR AS AN ORGANIZER.</p>

<p>One chief function of a pastor is to develop and utilize
the spiritual, mental, and social forces of the church.
There is in every congregation much latent force, which
needs to be developed, alike for the growth and usefulness
of those who possess it and for the results it might secure
for the church and the world. The minister is, in this
respect, a general to whom troops are entrusted; his work
is to train and organize and lead. The troops are to fight:
he is to inspire and direct the battle. Some hardworking
pastors take on themselves burdens which it were far
better to lay on the people&mdash;better for the pastor, in leaving
him free for other work, and better for the members,
in calling out their gifts. Indeed, one of the strongest
bonds which bind a church together is the consciousness
of being mutual workers, each having a post of duty and
<span class="pagenum" id="p103">[p.&nbsp;103]</span>
a share of responsibility. No member should be left in
a purely receptive attitude&mdash;a mere attendant and listener&mdash;but
each should have a place and a work assigned him.
That church attains the truest and highest growth in
which every member is a worker under the stimulus of a
consciousness of responsibility and of a useful sphere of
activity. Much of the imperfection of church-life is due
either to the fact that this latent force is undeveloped, or,
if developed, is misdirected. Here I suggest:</p>

<p>1. A pastor should carefully study his people with the
view of ascertaining and utilizing their special aptitudes
and gifts. The prayer-room, the Sunday-school, the teachers&rsquo;
meeting, and the pastoral visit all afford constant opportunities
for this. One may show aptitude for teaching
and may be entrusted with a Sunday-school class.
Another has the weight of character and the tact of leadership
which fit him for conducting a neighborhood prayer-meeting.
Another has the solid judgment and clear discernment
of character which will make him useful on
a committee of discipline or finance. Another, though
possibly not marked in exhortation or prayer, may have
social qualities such as admirably qualify him for managing
the details and arrangements of the social gatherings
of the congregation. A pastor who will constantly act on
the motto, <i>A place and a work for every member,</i> and will
press this motto on those who conduct the different departments
of work in his church, will soon find himself
at the head of an active, living, and ordinarily happy
people while yet he is not personally overburdened with
the details of church-work. In some instances of eminent
pastoral success, the chief secret has been in this power
of developing and utilizing the gifts of the church.</p>

<p>2. The organization of associations within the congregation
for different departments of work is another means
<span class="pagenum" id="p104">[p.&nbsp;104]</span>
of developing and utilizing the spiritual forces in the
church. I have spoken in another place of literary and
missionary organizations, but I may here add that an association
for Christian work composed of young men in a
church, and a similar one for young ladies, may often
prove of great value&mdash;the one to act among young men,
to attract and hold them to the church; the other for
like service among young women. To such associations
might be entrusted also mission Sunday-schools and distinct
spheres of missionary effort. In a large congregation
it is often desirable to organize committees for the care of
the sick and the poor, and the visitation of strangers needing
to be invited and welcomed to the congregation, and
of erring and sinning ones needing to be won back to holiness
and the church of God. In most places it is useful
to have committees for the general visitation of the field
occupied by the church, each committee being entrusted
with a distinct district in it and made responsible for its
cultivation. In neighborhoods remote from the church
much good is often secured in local prayer-meetings
placed under the supervision of some judicious person.
A thoughtful pastor, thoroughly supervising his field, will
find constant work, and manifold forms of it, in which
he can utilize either individuals or organizations in his
church; and in doing this there is a double blessing&mdash;that
which comes to the workers, in making them larger and
happier Christians, and that which comes to those for
whom they labor. Two things, however, are here to be
observed: (1.)&nbsp;Organizations should not be so multiplied
as to conflict with the general meetings of the church or
with each other. Each should subordinate its arrangements
to those of the church, and each should have its
own separate, distinctly-marked sphere. (2.)&nbsp;They should
be kept under the pastor&rsquo;s supervision and subject to
<span class="pagenum" id="p105">[p.&nbsp;105]</span>
his guidance. It will be readily seen that this supposes
care and tact on the part of the minister.</p>

<p>3. It is important that in this development of the forces
in a church the pastor should mark those cases among the
young in which special promise of intellectual ability appears
and should inspire and direct them toward a higher
education. Intellect is a gift of God: it is criminal to
leave it undeveloped. Be thoroughly alive to this fact
and impress it on the people. You will see young men
and young women in your congregation who might, with
adequate intellectual culture, occupy positions of power
in life, and carrying into those positions a Christian character
as well as a cultivated intellect might exert a wide
and beneficent influence for Christ in the world. It seems
to me one of the highest duties of a pastor to foster in
such minds a desire and purpose for an education, and to
facilitate in every possible way the attainment of that end.
He should perpetually stimulate the people to a larger and
higher intelligence, and never be satisfied unless numbers
of the youth of his church are in higher institutions of
learning. A failure to develop his people intellectually
is a discredit to any minister.</p>

<p>4. Another important end to be secured is the development
of ministerial gifts. The prayer-meeting, the Sunday-school,
and the general work of the church will commonly,
but not always, make these manifest. Sometimes
a very diffident young man may possess them, but only
encouragement will develop them. A pastor should be
on the watch and should take occasion to call out the
latent power. A few kindly words of encouragement have
often developed a man of ultimately wide usefulness.
Besides this class, there is much talent in the church that
could be utilized in lay-preaching, where men of good
speaking and spiritual knowledge, without relinquishing
<span class="pagenum" id="p106">[p.&nbsp;106]</span>
business pursuits, might be employed at destitute
points to proclaim the Gospel. A pastor&rsquo;s care is
needed in seeking out and setting at work these gifts for
lay-preaching, and thus multiplying the agencies for evangelization
around him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s11" class="tdc">SECTION XI.</h3>

<p class="tdc">FUNERAL SERVICES.</p>

<p>Funeral services bring the pastor into most tender and
influential relations to the families of his congregation,
but they are also among the most perplexing and difficult
parts of his work. Warm sympathy must here be combined
with wise discretion, or he may destroy at the funeral
the effect of his most faithful teaching in the pulpit.
Here I suggest:</p>

<p>1. Ordinarily, it is better to avoid a formal sermon at
funerals. It unnecessarily protracts the service, often to
the serious discomfort of the people, while it overtasks
the minister both in the preparation required and in the
performance of the duty. In case of the death of some
person occupying public station or official position in the
church a sermon may be proper, but even then, it is usually
better to deliver it on the following Sunday in the
church. Sometimes also, in districts remote from the
place of worship, where the people seldom hear preaching,
there may be an advantage in a full sermon. But
commonly a service at the house, brief, simple, tender, will
secure the best results. This usually consists of the reading
of a selection of Scriptures, an address, and a prayer.
Singing is added, if desired by the bereaved family and
singers are available.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p107">[p.&nbsp;107]</span>
2. Eulogies of the dead should be very sparingly indulged
and should in no case be made a prominent
feature. For much eulogy, even of confessedly good
qualities in the deceased, will almost always provoke
remembrance of any opposite qualities he may have had,
and will thus fail of its object. Besides, if eulogy forms
a marked feature in a minister&rsquo;s funeral addresses, the
omission of it, when ministering at the funeral of one
whom he cannot conscientiously eulogize, will be embarrassing
to him, and will often give offense to the friends.
An analysis of the character of the deceased at such a
time is a very delicate and difficult task, and it should
not be undertaken except in those comparatively rare
cases where the character has been so conspicuous for its
high qualities that the moral judgment of the community
instinctively recognizes it as a fitting model. Great
care should be exercised, also, in regard to expressing, in
the address or prayer, an opinion as to the spiritual
character and destiny of the deceased. A minister, in
the fervid sympathy evoked by the occasion, is sometimes
betrayed into forms of expression such as only Omniscience
may rightfully use. It is, indeed, his right, at
the interment of one whose Christian character has been
well attested, to assume that God&rsquo;s promises have been
fulfilled, and to speak gratefully and joyfully of the
blessedness of the pious dead; but in so doing he should
speak rather with the confidence of hope than with the
assumption of an absolute knowledge of the secrets of
the heart.</p>

<p>3. The subject-matter of the address will often be suggested
by the special circumstances connected with the
deceased or the occasion. Apart from these, many
general lines of thought will suggest themselves to the
thoughtful pastor. Of these the following may serve as
<span class="pagenum" id="p108">[p.&nbsp;108]</span>
hints: The fulness of power in the Gospel to prepare for
death, in its renewing, justifying, and sanctifying grace;
The blessedness of the Christian beyond death, as admitted
into the immediate presence of Christ and into
the purity and associations of that holy place where He
dwelleth; The glorious resurrection of the dead as the
completing act of redeeming power and the ultimate
goal of the Christian course; The certainty of the
Christian&rsquo;s hope, as based on the promises of an unchanging
God, contrasted with the uncertainty of all
earthly expectations. Or special phases of truth and
sources of consolation may be presented in the informal
development of some passage of Scripture. Thus: The
sympathy of Christ with the sorrowing, as seen at the
grave of Lazarus and on other occasions; The certainty
that affliction is not accidental but is ordered in the
infinite love and wisdom of God; The compassion and
tenderness of God, as seen in that He doth not afflict
willingly; The high and blessed results He intends in
affliction; The brevity of earthly sorrow and the
eternity of heavenly joy. Subjects adapted to such
occasions will continually suggest themselves to a pastor
who is in living, personal sympathy with his congregation;
and it is wise to note them down as they occur
and carefully preserve them. At the funeral of an
unconverted person the selection of a subject is sometimes
difficult; for here the minister, while he must
needs be a &ldquo;son of consolation&rdquo; to the bereaved, is also
under obligation to be faithful to the Gospel and to the
souls of men. He may not suggest, even by implication,
a hope respecting the deceased which neither his sober
judgment nor the truths he preaches allow him to feel;
nor may he pursue a line of remark adapted to weaken
a conviction of the solemn truth that a personal acceptance
<span class="pagenum" id="p109">[p.&nbsp;109]</span>
of Christ and a humble following of Him in this
life are absolutely essential to salvation; for in so doing
he would be inconsistent and untruthful. It is equally
evident, also, that in such a service, where he stands as a
minister of consolation, it is not his duty to aggravate the
sorrow of the bereaved by specially emphasizing the
fearful doom of the unbeliever. Perhaps the general
course of thought for such occasions would be found
in topics which relate to the brevity and uncertainty
of life; the way of salvation in the Gospel; the rectitude and
tenderness of God&rsquo;s providence; the refuge for the
afflicted in the sympathy and salvation of Christ&mdash;topics
which, while necessitating no allusion to the spiritual
character and state of the deceased, yet afford ample
scope for presenting the nature and urgencies of the
Gospel and the true sources of consolation for the
bereaved. Whatever the topic, the spirit and manner
should be dictated and pervaded by a genuine sympathy
for the sorrowing, and a hearty appreciation of whatever
was excellent in the character and life of the deceased.
Though not a Christian, he may have been a valuable
citizen, a just and generous man, a true and unselfish
friend, a good husband and father. If any personal
remarks are made, such characteristics may properly
be recognized on such an occasion as honoring his memory
and rendering his death a loss to the world.</p>

<p>4. The service at the grave should ordinarily be brief,
as the people are standing, and the circumstances of the
place render an extended service undesirable. Some
pastors use here some one of the printed manuals of
burial services, others read from Scripture, or repeat
from memory, a selection of passages relating to death,
the grave, and the resurrection, and others make a
<span class="pagenum" id="p110">[p.&nbsp;110]</span>
brief address. Whatever the method adopted, the service
should be carefully prepared, and should vary in its
form, in order to secure in this, as in all services, variety
and adaptation to the occasion. The service is closed by
the apostolic benediction, prefaced sometimes by a few
words of prayer.</p>

<p>5. It is desirable to visit the family in which death has
occurred before the funeral services, both to express your
sympathy in the affliction and to learn any facts respecting
the deceased and the arrangements for the funeral
that may be necessary for you to know. The pastor
should here have the character of an adviser and friend.
In all arrangements for the funeral it is better, in general,
to conform to the customs of the community; but so far
as he may use influence in regard to these, it should be in
favor of inexpensive simplicity and against ostentatious
display. Costliness and display at funerals constitute in
many communities an evil of such serious proportions
and consequences that the ministry should decidedly set
their face against it; for, established as an inexorable custom,
it often augments and perpetuates the sorrow of a
death in the family by creating debt and pecuniary embarrassment
which remain for years to come. It is also
important to visit the family soon after the funeral to
administer further consolation, and to follow up any good
impressions which affliction has made. This is often one
of the pastor&rsquo;s best opportunities, as the heart is then tender
and susceptible to religious influences. It is in these
dark hours of adversity that the Gospel is felt in its saving,
consoling, helping power in the soul, and the pastor
here should work with Providence, carefully improving
the opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="s12" class="tdc">SECTION XII.</h3>

<p class="tdc">CULTIVATION OF THE MISSIONARY SPIRIT.</p>

<p>The importance of a deep, all-pervading missionary
spirit in the church can hardly be overrated. Its value
is not to be estimated only in the work done and the
money raised for the spread of the Gospel, but also in the
enlarged and enriched life of the church itself, and the
higher and nobler type of Christian character it thus presents
to the world. A pastor who fails in this is failing
at once to make his church a power for Christ in the
world, and to secure within it the fulness of life which
Christ intended it should possess.</p>

<p>To develop and foster a missionary spirit in the church
requires, as a first necessity, the presence of such a spirit
in the pastor himself. Without this no method, however
excellent, will be likely to succeed; but with it the spirit
of missions will not appear merely on special missionary
occasions, but will pervade all his public utterances in
the pulpit and the prayer-room. It will diffuse itself as
an atmosphere of life through the whole congregation, and,
inbreathed, it will impart vitality and power to the whole
body. But, added to this general influence, a fixed method
of labor for this is desirable, and in regard to this I make
the following suggestions:</p>

<p>1. A regular system of contribution for benevolent
objects, taken either by subscription paper or by public
collection or in boxes conveniently placed for receiving
the funds. It is the custom of many churches to divide
the year into four or six periods, devoting two or three
months, as the case may be, to each of the benevolent
objects; and this has often proved successful. Whatever
plan is adopted, it should secure regularity of contribution,
<span class="pagenum" id="p112">[p.&nbsp;112]</span>
and should reach the whole congregation, old and
young, rich and poor; otherwise, only the few will contribute,
and the blessing connected with self-denying
giving will be lost by the mass of the people.</p>

<p>2. A missionary sermon at least as often as the recurrence
of these periods. In these sermons the great principles
of benevolence should be developed and enforced,
and the leading facts in the different departments of
Christian work spread before the people. It is not necessary
or desirable to preach a &ldquo;begging sermon&rdquo; with sensational
incitements to give. In fact, our Lord&rsquo;s great
principle, &ldquo;It is more blessed to give than to receive&rdquo;
(Acts xx.&nbsp;35), suggests that giving should be presented,
not as a duty chiefly, but rather as an exalted privilege
whose reward is in itself. Properly prepared, &ldquo;the missionary
sermon&rdquo; may be made a most attractive feature
in the pastor&rsquo;s public work; and if steadily kept in view
and materials carefully preserved for it as they occur in
his reading and reflection, the preparation will not be
difficult. A special note-book, preserving thoughts and
illustrations for missionary sermons, will rapidly fill up
with a pastor who reads with method and care.</p>

<p>3. The monthly missionary concert of prayer. This is
of vital importance, because here the missionary spirit of
the church finds devotional expression. The pastor makes
a serious mistake who fails to maintain this or allows it
to be regarded as of minor moment. No meeting is capable
of being made more effective for his home work than
the monthly concert, properly conducted. In regard to
this I offer the following hints: (1.)&nbsp;It is not necessary to
restrict the sphere of the meeting to foreign missions, but
there are important advantages in allowing it to embrace
all departments of evangelization, home and foreign,
through the different branches of work&mdash;in the pulpit,
<span class="pagenum" id="p113">[p.&nbsp;113]</span>
the school, and the press. Thus one evening might be
devoted to the condition of the freedmen at the South and
the work in progress among them, educational and missionary;
another to the work of home missions on the
frontiers of civilization at the West, developing the leading
facts respecting the vast immigration into those new regions,
the needs of Christian workers there, and the kind of
work there to be performed; and another to the Karens or
Assamese or Chinese, or other division of the foreign work.
The meeting would thus be highly educative by the whole
range of its information, and would promote a broad intelligence
in the membership, while the breadth of the
field would afford an unfailing variety of vital subjects to
interest and hold the people. (2.)&nbsp;In opening, the pastor
might present a brief survey of the whole field, selecting
only events of special interest and incidents adapted to
impress them. This might be followed by one or more
papers or statements, from selected members of the church
or congregation, on the special field chosen for the evening,
or on some prominent laborer in it, the time of the speaker
or reader being carefully limited. This would leave ample
time for prayer, which is the main purpose of the meeting,
and for such spontaneous utterances as might be made by
the assembly.</p>

<p>The hints above suggested are necessarily imperfect and
general, for every church has its peculiarities, and the pastor
must often adapt his methods to theirs. But the object
to be attained, the missionary development of the church,
is of the highest moment, and he should study methods
with the fixed purpose of reaching, in some way, that end.</p>

<h3 id="s13" class="tdc">SECTION XIII.</h3>

<p class="tdc">THE PULPIT AND THE PRESS.</p>

<p>In the olden time the Bible formed the chief reading of
Christian congregations, and the pulpit occupied the place
of power in popular instruction. This is now changed.
The newspaper, the magazine, the popular novel, the multitudinous
products of the press, crowd the Bible from its
former place even in religious families, and the platform
and the press rival the pulpit as vital educative forces in
guiding and controlling popular thought. It is useless to
declaim against this; it is one of the great facts of providence
connected with our age and life; but the wise pastor
will carefully consider what he can do to control this inevitably
potent force of the press, and make it a help instead
of a hindrance to his work; for with proper supervision
this vast power may be made a most beneficent auxiliary
to the pulpit. Here I suggest:</p>

<p>1. The pastor should aim to secure in every family a
good religious newspaper. This is a matter of primary
moment, for such a paper is an ever-present force, educating
religious thought and feeling and enriching and elevating
practical life. Most pastors would be startled, on making
the inquiry, to find how few families in their congregation
take a religious paper, and how many are taking only
trashy and often morally poisonous publications, the
habitual reading of which must utterly neutralize the instruction
and influence of the pulpit. The magazine and
newspaper are the habitual reading of the family circle;
and the pastor who fails to exercise watchful care in regard
to the character of this reading will often find it one of
the most destructive forces at work among his people.</p>

<p>2. The intelligent and thoughtful minister, in his public
<span class="pagenum" id="p115">[p.&nbsp;115]</span>
and private work, will often call the attention of his people
to good books, and use his influence to introduce them.
His people, pressed under secular care and toil, are most
of them not in a position to judge of the value and tendency
of the literature offered to them; and they rightfully
look to him, as an intelligent and studious man, to guide
their judgment in the selection of reading. The Sunday-school
library also should be carefully selected under his
eye and secured a wide circulation. In a large congregation
it may sometimes be of advantage to have a reading-room
and a circulating library, placed under the care of
some association; and over this also the pastor&rsquo;s watchful
supervision will be required. He should also provide himself
with tracts&mdash;brief, simple, pungent, clearly setting forth
sin, redemption, repentance, faith, and Christian duties&mdash;such
as may awaken the careless, guide the inquirer, and
press to duty the hesitant Christian. These little winged
evangels are most valuable auxiliaries in his pastoral work
and should be kept for judicious circulation in the inquiry
meeting, in pastoral visitation, and in seasons of revival.
As issued by our Publication Society, they are now of
such wide variety and high value, and of such slight cost,
that no pastor should allow himself to neglect a means so
important to his
<span class="wsnw">success.<a id="s8_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#s8_fn1">[1]</a></span></p>

<p>3. The subject of reading and books should also be presented
in the pulpit that the great importance of care in
this may be felt, and the purity of the homes of the people
be guarded against a pernicious influence of a poisoned
literature. Many a Christian parent has never been aroused
<span class="pagenum" id="p116">[p.&nbsp;116]</span>
to the real peril in which he is placing his family by the
reading he thoughtlessly admits to the home circle.</p>

<p>4. A pastor should also seek to inspire and elevate the
public sentiment of the community where he is located
in regard to schools, lyceums, libraries, and public lectures,
so as to secure pure and Christian influences at these important
fountains of public opinion and character. As an
educated man and a Christian minister, this duty naturally
devolves on him; and his influence, rightly and quietly
used, may often determine the question whether the schools
shall be under Christian or non-Christian instruction, or
whether the lecture-course shall be filled by men who revere
God&rsquo;s Word or by those who hate and traduce it.
No minister ought to be indifferent to the public sentiment
around him; for it is the intellectual and moral
atmosphere in which his people live, and which must
needs tend either to poison or to purify their souls.</p>

<div class="footnotes"><h4 class="tdc">FOOTNOTES:</h4>
<div class="footnote" id="s8_fn1"><p><a href="#s8_fna1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
It would be well were every church to see that the pastor is furnished
with a sufficient supply of such publications. Some churches
are accustomed to make regular provision for this object. They believe
that the soldier should not be expected to purchase his own
ammunition.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s14" class="tdc">SECTION XIV.</h3>

<p class="tdc">RELATIONS TO OTHER DENOMINATIONS.</p>

<p>The pastor&rsquo;s position and work bring him into contact
with other ministers and churches in the community,
and his comfort and usefulness will to some extent depend
on the esteem and confidence with which he is regarded
by evangelical Christians outside of his own church. He
will find many of the noblest Christian men and women in
churches differing in name from his own, and he should
seek to maintain with them the most frank and cordial
relations. This is especially important as regards the pastors,
since, when relations of mutual affection and confidence
exist, the ministry in any community can be eminently
<span class="pagenum" id="p117">[p.&nbsp;117]</span>
helpful to each other, and by combining their
counsels and influence can often greatly advance the religious
interests of the whole people. I suggest, therefore:</p>

<p>1. Do not isolate yourself, standing aloof from the general
Christian community, but seek the acquaintance of all
good men. Show a friendly, cordial spirit and a readiness
for all offices of kindness, alike in the relations of social
life and on those public occasions when all Christians
gather for united counsel and worship. In such a course
you will find the love and sympathy of the Christian
community attracted to you, greatly augmenting your
comfort and influence, and giving added power to your
public work.</p>

<p>2. Such friendly relations among Christians of differing
views involve of necessity a full recognition of their common
Christian character and a hearty accord, each to the
other, of sincerity and purity of motive in their church
position. This a just self-respect requires you to insist
on for yourself, and this, in the spirit of genuine charity,
you should freely accord to others; such a position is consistent
with the most full and free expression of your denominational
sentiments and the most earnest defense
of them. It simply requires that amidst the different
opinions of Christian men there should be a charitable
judgment of each other&rsquo;s character, and a careful abstinence
from language that might reflect on the motives of
those who differ. It is, I think, the common fact that
the genuine respect and confidence of any Christian community
are most fully secured by that pastor who, while
always decided and earnest in the expression and defense
of his denominational convictions, is also always careful,
in the spirit of true charity, to recognize the sincerity and
integrity of those whose convictions may be opposed.</p>

<p>3. An occasional exchange of pulpits by the evangelical
<span class="pagenum" id="p118">[p.&nbsp;118]</span>
ministers in the community has many advantages.
It is a public recognition of the substantial unity of
Protestant Christendom. It gives to the minister a wider
audience than if always limited to his own congregation,
thus enlarging his acquaintance and tending to secure for
him the interest and confidence of the whole people. It
is sometimes a relief, enabling him to make use of former
pulpit preparations when specially pressed by the exigencies
of pastoral work. In such an exchange it is
obvious that courtesy and comity require that the minister
should conform to the usages of worship observed in
the congregation where he is thus officiating, and that
the subject presented should belong to the Gospel as held
in common by evangelical Christians, and not to matters
controverted among them. In this, as in all relations
with other pastors and churches, the minister should
observe with scrupulous delicacy the requirements of
courtesy and honor.</p>

<p>4. Union meetings are sometimes held by churches of
different denominations for the promotion of a revival
of religion, during the progress of which each church is
expected to waive its distinctive peculiarities and all
unitedly press on men the claims of the common Gospel.
Such a union of effort has undoubtedly proved useful
among feeble churches and in neighborhood meetings
remote from large centers of population; for there, from
the paucity of numbers and gifts, all the Christian forces
must needs be concentrated in order to maintain the interest.
In such meetings every consideration of honor
requires that the subjects presented should be restricted
to those common truths of the Gospel in which all are
united; a departure from this is always to be deplored.
Among strong churches, however, where gifts abound, the
utility of such a union is more doubtful; indeed, it is
<span class="pagenum" id="p119">[p.&nbsp;119]</span>
questionable whether there are not positive disadvantages.
For, (1.)&nbsp;The members of the participating churches in
such a meeting are placed under unusual circumstances
which often serve to repress rather than develop their
activity, and thus the labor falls on only a few more prominently
gifted persons; whereas, a meeting in which the
responsibility rested on only one church would have
drawn into active work the mass of its members, and
secured to it the blessing which such general activity
brings. (2.)&nbsp;According to the Baptist faith, the ordinances
of the Gospel vividly set forth Divine truth before
men, and in the experience of our churches their administration
is commonly attended by the convicting power
of the Holy Spirit in the consciences of those who witness
them. But in a union meeting these cannot be administered,
or even alluded to, without impropriety, and
this element of power is lost. (3.)&nbsp;It is not unfrequent,
at the close of such meetings, that the efforts of such
churches to secure members from the converts result in
friction and unkind feeling&mdash;an evil sometimes more than
counterbalancing the good done in the temporary union.
While, therefore, it is not denied that union meetings
have sometimes been useful, as a general thing they are
not desirable. A church will ordinarily develop more
effectively its own gifts and its own spiritual power by
working alone and in accordance with its own principles
and methods. It allows its light to shine most fully
and clearly only when it steadily teaches and defends
whatever of truth it has learned by the teachings of
the Word of God. At the same time, its relations
to the other churches in the community will, in the
long run, be far less likely to be embarrassed and embittered.</p>

<p class="tdc">CHANGE OF FIELD.</p>

<p>Instability in the pastoral office is the common fact
and every pastor, sooner or later, meets the question,
Shall I change my field? One cause of this is to be found,
doubtless, in the restless spirit of the age, which is impatient
with the old and ever clamoring for the new.
This is specially the case in our country and is one of
the natural results of rapid growth and a widely-diffused
spirt of enterprise.</p>

<p class="cgap">I. <span class="smcap">Evils of Change.</span></p>

<p>The evils of a change of field are many and serious and
only the most imperative reasons will justify a pastor in
making it. For, 1.&nbsp;It involves a serious loss in the pastor&rsquo;s
working capital, for the confidence and love of a congregation,
which a true minister acquires, constitute a chief element
in his power. These, however unlike mere popularity,
are only slowly acquired; but, once secured, they add
immensely to the value of his public and private work.
But this advantage is all relinquished on leaving the field,
and must be again slowly acquired at another post. A
pastor&rsquo;s power also to benefit a people by a wise adaptation
of his work to their character and needs must depend
largely on his knowledge of them; but in making a
change this is lost, and can be regained only by similar
study of a new congregation. 2.&nbsp;Few ministers widen
their range of original investigation after their first pastorate.
At the first post they are compelled to push out
into new lines of thought, but in a new field the temptation
to use old subjects, if not old sermons, often proves
irresistible, and their life-thinking is likely to move round
<span class="pagenum" id="p121">[p.&nbsp;121]</span>
in the same narrow range. Pastoral change often thus
checks intellectual and theological growth. 3.&nbsp;This restless
expectation of change also discourages broad, comprehensive
plans for the instruction and development of
the church, and tempts the minister to aim exclusively at
immediate results. Hence, his sermons are largely sentimental
or sensational, confined within a limited range of
topics, and the development of church-life is correspondingly
dwarfed. 4.&nbsp;The marked decline in public respect
for the ministry is probably in part a result of this feverish
restlessness, which weakens confidence in them as men of
high, unselfish purpose, and compels a community to regard
the minister no longer as a permanent force in its life,
but rather as a transient sensation.</p>

<p class="cgap">II. <span class="smcap">Inadequate Causes of Change.</span></p>

<p>Many causes operate to unsettle a pastor which ought
not to produce that result; indeed, some of them, if rightly
interpreted, would have served rather to strengthen than to
dissolve the pastoral relation. Thus, 1.&nbsp;Mental depression.
A sedentary, studious life often induces abnormal nervous
conditions, and the hypochondriac misinterprets the feelings
of the people and underestimates the results of his
ministry. A change is in consequence resolved on, which
subsequent developments show to have been wholly unnecessary.
2.&nbsp;The loss of popularity. This is often due to
real defects in the character and work of the pastor, and
its true remedy is not a change of field, but a correction
of his faults. Imperfect preparation has, perhaps, made
his sermons commonplace and his pulpit a failure. Or he
has failed to cultivate executive, pastoral, and social power,
and, as a result, the church is not in effective working
condition, and no bonds of personal sympathy and affection
bind pastor to people. Or there are imperfections
<span class="pagenum" id="p122">[p.&nbsp;122]</span>
in his spirit and life, and these forbid confidence and respect
on the part of the congregation. In all such cases a
loss of popularity does not indicate so much a change of
field as a change in the spirit, plan, and work of the pastor,
for these defects would in any field soon lead to the same
result. 3.&nbsp;Difficulties in the church. Such trials enter
more or less into every minister&rsquo;s lot, but they may be no
indication of duty to change. The trial may be sent as a
discipline, designed to develop, through faith and patience,
a nobler character and higher power in the pastor. Change
in this case is only a cowardly running away from duty,
and consequent failure to gain an intended blessing. Many
a disruption of the pastoral tie, it may be feared, is thus
only a shrinking from trial and intended discipline and
results only in loss to pastor and people. 4.&nbsp;Ambitious
seeking for distinguished position. There is an unhallowed
ambition which, unsatisfied with advancement
through natural growth, is ever restlessly seeking, by
newspaper notoriety, sensational sermons, and influential
friends, to secure prominent places in the ministry. A
vacant pulpit in a conspicuous church is usually beset by
many such ambitious aspirants for place and notoriety.
It is hardly necessary to suggest that such a spirit is at
the farthest possible remove from the genuine spirit of
the Christian pastor; and in the end it reacts disastrously
on the reputation of him who indulges it, for self-seeking
and pretense are sure, sooner or later, to be exposed.</p>

<p class="cgap">III. <span class="smcap">Valid Reasons for Change.</span></p>

<p>A change of field is doubtless sometimes the duty of a
pastor, and the providence and Spirit of God, which guided
him in forming the pastoral relation, will make equally
plain the obligation to dissolve it. Some of the reasons
which may require a change are the following: 1.&nbsp;Growth
<span class="pagenum" id="p123">[p.&nbsp;123]</span>
in pulpit and pastoral power beyond the scope of the field.
A young man has settled, perhaps, in a circumscribed field.
Fidelity in study and labor has developed him, so that his
capacity plainly fits him for a wider sphere. If this is made
evident by the judgment of his brethren and the providence
of God, he is required by duty, alike to his own life-usefulness
and to the cause of Christ, to enter the wider field
opened before him. 2.&nbsp;The necessities of health in himself
or family. The severity of the draft made in this age
on the intellect and nerves of the minister may sometimes
compel change so as to obtain relief by the more free use
of previous pulpit preparations. This, though unfortunate
for the intellectual growth of the minister, is still to be
chosen rather than broken health. Or the climate may
prove unfavorable, and on this account a change be demanded.
3.&nbsp;Inadequate salary. The pecuniary support
may be insufficient for the growing needs of the pastor,
and a new post with larger salary may be opened to him.
Here, however, great care must be taken in scrutinizing
motives, for a wealthy church and a large salary have glittering
attraction and appeal strongly to mere selfishness.
The need of a larger income must be real, not fancied.
4.&nbsp;Permanent discomfort and embarrassment in his work. A
minister, even after the most conscientious discharge of
his duties, will sometimes find controlling influences in
the church arrayed against him, or his cherished plans of
church work defeated by counter-counsels; so that the
pastor and permanent and influential members of the
church are in relations wholly incompatible with comfort
or efficiency. Now, if these relations cannot be altered, it
would seem clearly his duty to leave, and to enter a field
where his relations will be congenial and his labors unobstructed.</p>

<p>Finally, I suggest: A pastor must expect trials in any
<span class="pagenum" id="p124">[p.&nbsp;124]</span>
church, and commonly, in a change of place, he will
only find a change in the form of trial. It is a serious
question whether in most instances of change a simple
faith in God, a patient forbearance, and a persistence in
faithful work would not have avoided the necessity and
added much to the strength of the pastor in the higher
development of all the forces of his intellectual, moral,
and spiritual nature, and in the enlargement of his
influence as a minister of Christ. Certainly, the unrest
so widely seen now in the ministry argues a great wrong
somewhere, either in pastors or in churches, and is serving
to deteriorate the character and weaken the influence
of both.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s16" class="tdc">SECTION XVI.</h3>

<p class="tdc">MINISTERS NOT IN THE PASTORAL OFFICE.</p>

<p>All ministers are not called to the pastorate; and it is
sometimes the duty of those who were once called to that
position to leave it and enter a different department of
ministerial work. In the ministry which the ascended
Christ gives His church, besides pastors, there are &ldquo;evangelists&rdquo;
and &ldquo;teachers&rdquo;&mdash;terms designating important
classes of ministers permanently existing in the kingdom
of God. A brief characterization of these, and of the
functions with which they are charged, may properly
be presented here.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">First, Evangelists.</span></p>

<p>Of this class, Philip, Barnabas, Apollos, Timothy, and
Titus are examples in Scripture&mdash;men having no permanent,
local charge, but commissioned to preach and
<span class="pagenum" id="p125">[p.&nbsp;125]</span>
administer the ordinances of the Gospel wherever the
Spirit and providence of God might call. These men
were engaged, for the most part, in work analogous to
that of our foreign and home missionaries&mdash;preaching the
Gospel where it was not already preached, organizing
churches, and supervising them in their incipiency while
yet feeble and struggling. It is probable, also, that at
times their work resembled that of those men called, in
a narrower sense, evangelists&mdash;men engaged in assisting
pastors and churches in special services for the promotion
of revivals of religion. Possibly, Barnabas, when sent by
the church at Jerusalem to labor in the great awakening
at Antioch, may be conceived as acting in such a capacity,
as also Timothy when left in Ephesus by Paul to hold in
check certain heretical tendencies in that city (Acts xi.&nbsp;22&ndash;24;
1&nbsp;Tim. i.&nbsp;3, 4). Evangelists, therefore, may be
considered under the following classifications:</p>

<p>I. <span class="smcap">Foreign Missionaries.</span>&mdash;In considering the question
of duty to enter the foreign field, the first inquiry
necessarily relates to qualification, since without this no
mere desire or emotion in regard to the work can have
any weight. As among the more obvious requisites for
the missionary work the following may be mentioned:
1.&nbsp;<i>A sound body.</i> Most of our mission-fields are in the
East, in an enervating climate, and under conditions such
as severely test the vigor of the physical constitution.
No person already enfeebled by disease or seriously predisposed
to disease should venture into the foreign field,
as the probabilities would all be against his ability to
labor there. On this point, it is obvious, skilled medical
advice should be sought. 2.&nbsp;<i>Common sense.</i> The practical
administration of the affairs of the mission, temporal
as well as spiritual&mdash;its building, its finances, its business
contracts and relations, the whole management&mdash;usually
<span class="pagenum" id="p126">[p.&nbsp;126]</span>
falls upon the missionary, and requires large practical
tact and sagacity. In a new field he has no reliable
advisers and must depend on his own judgment in deciding
on all the temporal concerns of the mission. In
the older fields, while some of the business cares may be
devolved on native helpers, he must still move among
the native churches as a practical and influential adviser,
guiding their affairs, settling their difficulties, and correcting
their mistakes. An unpractical, visionary mind,
however scholarly and brilliant, is obviously unfitted
for such a position. 3.&nbsp;<i>Facility in learning to speak in a
foreign tongue.</i> A foreign language, and most of all an
Oriental language, is difficult to acquire, especially so as
to use it readily and fluently in common speech. Some
men of good abilities have here failed in the foreign field,
and, though useful perhaps in other departments, have
never been effective in preaching. There should be, at
least, an ordinary aptitude for language sufficient to
ensure that with persevering effort the man will be able
to master and use the vernacular of the people. 4.&nbsp;<i>Power
as a preacher.</i> Preaching, among the heathen as elsewhere,
is the grand means of evangelization, and the
conditions of power in it are everywhere essentially the
same. The missionary must be &ldquo;apt to teach,&rdquo; with a
ready command of his faculties for argument and illustration,
and a mastery of the art of putting things. In the
conversational method of preaching in heathen lands, he
is often obliged to meet in popular argument acute and
profound reasoners, when his defeat before the people
might prove a serious check to the Gospel. 5.&nbsp;<i>Faith,
energy, and perseverance.</i> At these outposts of Christianity
a timid, wavering spirit, faint-hearted and irresolute,
will be sure to fail. Courage, determination, energy,
alone will achieve permanent results. Carey and Judson
<span class="pagenum" id="p127">[p.&nbsp;127]</span>
waited years with unfaltering confidence for the first
convert, and without substantially the same elements
of character no man will succeed in pioneer work.</p>

<p>In deciding on the qualifications of a young man, however,
it is to be remembered that he is as yet, in many
respects, undeveloped, and qualities now present only in
the germ and tendency will often in the actual work reveal
themselves in marked power. Abroad, as at home,
circumstances and emergencies develop the man. No
young man, therefore, may hastily dismiss the question
of a personal call to the foreign field on the ground of disqualification.
Rather, he should carefully study his own
character, and seek counsel of those best fitted to judge his
capabilities, that in deciding a question of such moment
he may act deliberately, with a full and impartial view of
all the considerations, and with a clear conscience, always
recognizing the danger that unconsciously to ourselves
our selfishness is likely to magnify the reasons adverse to
a missionary life and underestimate the force of those in
favor of it.</p>

<p>The nature of the missionary work and the manner of
its prosecution I shall not here consider: these will be
found very fully presented in the work of the late lamented
Rev. M.&nbsp;J. Knowlton, D.D., <i>The Foreign Missionary,</i> and in
that of Rev. Dr. Rufus Anderson, entitled, <i>Foreign Missions,
their Relations and Claims.</i> The position of a missionary
is in some respects one of great delicacy, and requires on
his part the most careful circumspection. Here may be
mentioned: 1.&nbsp;His relation to the Missionary Board at
home. Charged with the administration of the funds
entrusted to them by the churches, the Board must of
necessity exercise a certain measure of supervision and
guidance in the conduct of the foreign work. The exact
line of demarcation between the authority of the Board
<span class="pagenum" id="p128">[p.&nbsp;128]</span>
and the independence of the missionary in directing movements
is not always easy to discover, and without a spirit
of gentleness, forbearance, and concession the most serious
complications may arise. In the expenditures of the mission,
also, the keeping and rendering of an exact account
are of the utmost moment, so as to avoid even the suspicion
of wastefulness or malappropriation. The rule of Paul
is here, as in all financial trusts, the only safe one: &ldquo;Being
careful of this, that no one should blame us in this abundance
which is administered by us; for we provide for
what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord, but
also in the sight of men&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. viii.&nbsp;20,
<span class="wsnw">21<a id="s16_fna1" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#s16_fn1">[1]</a>).</span> 2.&nbsp;His
relations to the native pastors and churches are also of
great delicacy. In the older missions the work of the
missionary is largely that of general supervision of the
native churches. But in this the missionary may not
exercise an arbitrary power. He is not a bishop with authoritative
episcopal power, subjecting the pastors under
control and ignoring the independence of the churches.
Rather, his power is moral, and his work is to train the
churches and pastors for the independent exercise of their
respective functions. He should, therefore, carefully guard
against an arbitrary spirit or any methods of procedure
which could militate against the just independence of pastors
and churches. It is a distinguished proof of the high
character of the noble men who have gone out as missionaries
that, while in these and other respects their relations
are of such delicacy, difficulties between them and
the home Board have so rarely arisen, and the churches
they have trained so fully exemplify in their character,
organization, and working the simplicity and independence
of the churches of the New Testament.</p>

<p>II. <span class="smcap">Home Missionaries.</span>&mdash;Most of these are pastors of
<span class="pagenum" id="p129">[p.&nbsp;129]</span>
new or feeble churches, and their position differs from that
of ordinary pastors only in the fact that their support is
derived in part from some missionary organization, and
that they are under consequent obligation to render a
report of their work to the body which thus aids in sustaining
them. Some of them, however, are engaged in
purely itinerant ministerial work in the waste places of
our cities, or in newly-settled or unevangelized parts of
our country, visiting from house to house, preaching as
Providence may give opportunity, organizing Sunday-schools,
and forming churches. Few positions demand
more force of character, soundness of judgment, intellectual
ability, indomitable energy, and self-sacrificing devotion.
Among the men occupied in this work are some
of the noblest and most devoted servants of Christ. Their
duties, however, being in most respects the same as those
of ordinary pastors, do not need here a separate treatment.</p>

<p>III. <span class="smcap">Revivalists.</span>&mdash;In all ages gifts have been bestowed
specially adapted to the awakening and conversion of
souls. These gifts may not, and sometimes do not, fit
the man for the pastoral office, but as supplementing a
pastor&rsquo;s gifts they are often of high value. The revivalist
may not always possess the learning and teaching power
of the settled pastor; he might perhaps fail in the qualities
essential to the continuous guiding, organizing, and
governing of a church; but in power to make vivid the
truths and impressions already received by the people,
to develop hitherto latent conviction, and to press men
to a definite and avowed religious decision, he may be
specially gifted. Some pastors eminent in teaching and
pastoral qualifications lack the awakening power, and
thus it is often true in the spiritual work that &ldquo;one soweth
and another reapeth.&rdquo; In such cases the revivalist
comes as a reaper, with special gifts for ingathering, where
<span class="pagenum" id="p130">[p.&nbsp;130]</span>
the long and patient toil of the sower and cultivator has
preceded him and has already prepared in the souls of
the people the ripening spiritual harvest.</p>

<p>1. The relation of the evangelist to the pastor, in special
religious services, is always one of great delicacy. The
most frank understanding and cordial co-operation between
them is of the highest moment. Much care, therefore,
should be taken not to encroach on the prerogatives
of the pastoral office, or to lessen the estimation in which
the pastor is held by the people. There is sometimes
danger of this. The sermons of the evangelist, limited
as they are in number and frequently repeated, not only
have the attraction of novelty to the people, but are often
spiced with a fulness of anecdote and delivered with a
freedom and force which the pastor&rsquo;s cannot possess, by
reason of the different and wider range of subjects which
he must discuss and the far heavier and more extended
draft made on his resources. The less thoughtful hearers
will contrast what seems to them to be the comparative
dullness of the pastor with the freshness and spice of the
evangelist, and the pastor unjustly suffers. Among the
converts also there is often a special attraction to him
who had been the immediate agent in their conversion,
while the long and patient toil of him who had probably
prepared the way for that final step is overlooked or disparaged.
Plainly, it is the duty of the evangelist to
recognize and hold in check these tendencies, and to
strengthen in every possible way the pastor&rsquo;s position
in the convictions and affections of the people. He
may thus render his work a permanent blessing in the
churches by making it the means of cementing the relation
of pastor and people.</p>

<p>2. A young pastor will naturally defer in the arrangements
for the meetings to the judgment and experience
<span class="pagenum" id="p131">[p.&nbsp;131]</span>
of the evangelist, but it is doubtful whether, under any
circumstances, an evangelist should seek the control of
them, or a pastor should concede it to him. Especially
should the pastor maintain the control of those meetings
in which candidates for admission to the church are examined;
for here the pastor, apart from the official duty
Christ has laid on him in this vital matter, has by his
acquaintance with the people much better qualifications
for judging character, and is far less likely to mistake than
a stranger. Indeed, the temptation to seek the <i>&eacute;clat</i> of a
large accession of converts may enter as an unconscious
influence in the case of both evangelist and pastor, leading
to undue haste and neglect of just discrimination in
the admission of members, and resulting in great ultimate
injury to the church. No point, therefore, needs to
be more carefully guarded.</p>

<p>3. The object of the evangelist is the awakening of
souls and the revival of religion; his subjects, therefore,
are properly adapted in their nature and in the manner
of their presentation to secure that result. The range of
topics is thus necessarily limited, and the manner is naturally
stimulating and exciting. From this comparative
narrowness in the range of his theme and of his biblical
and theological investigation, there is danger of one-sidedness
in his views of truth. Seeking as he does, also, immediate
results, he is liable to fail in perceiving and estimating
at their just importance ultimate results in the permanent
life and power of the church. Measures have
sometimes been adopted in the midst of a religious excitement
which the calm after-thought of the people could
not approve, and the result has been a reaction in the
public judgment, condemning the work and seriously
injuring the church.</p>

<p>4. Eccentricity in the evangelist, when it is natural as
<span class="pagenum" id="p132">[p.&nbsp;132]</span>
a part of his individuality, may possibly be an element
of power, at least as awakening curiosity and calling the
people to the house of God, but when assumed and cultivated
with a view to popular effect it is always unfortunate.
Sensational subjects, slang phrases, vulgarisms,
overcolored anecdotes, exaggerated statements, oddities
of manner, though for the moment exciting the attention,
and possibly the applause, of the audience, inevitably in
the end react to the disadvantage of the speaker and his
cause; the sober after-thought of even the irreligious will
condemn them in one who is dealing with souls in the
great concerns of religion.</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;He that negotiates between God and man,<br />
&nbsp;As God&rsquo;s ambassador, the grand concerns<br />
&nbsp;Of judgment and of mercy should beware<br />
&nbsp;Of lightness in his speech. &rsquo;Tis pitiful<br />
&nbsp;To court a grin when you should woo a soul;<br />
&nbsp;To break a jest when pity would inspire<br />
&nbsp;Pathetic exhortation; and t&rsquo; address<br />
&nbsp;The skittish fancy with pathetic tales<br />
&nbsp;When sent with God&rsquo;s commission to the
<span class="wsnw">heart.&rdquo;<a id="s16_fna2" /><a class="fnanchor" href="#s16_fn2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>The evangelist, perhaps, is in special danger of seeking
the temporary advantage which eccentricity brings, because
for the time it gathers the multitude to his preaching;
and, leaving soon, he fails to see the disastrous reaction
which afterward it is sure to bring.</p>

<p>5. Some of the most eminent evangelists have used
substantially the same subjects through their entire
career, at each repetition of them adding to their clearness
and force of argument vividness of illustration and
effectiveness of appeal. Rev. Jacob Knapp, whose work
has perhaps been surpassed in extent and power by no
preacher of the present century, adopted this method.
<span class="pagenum" id="p133">[p.&nbsp;133]</span>
The writer was with him in three series of meetings, the
first near the opening of his remarkable career, the last
about thirty years after, near its close, and in each of these
that distinguished revivalist used, for the most part, the
same subjects. But the advance in all elements of power
was immense, especially in the last repetition of his
course. Few persons in the vast multitude which gathered
daily for six successive weeks to listen to this, which
proved the closing series of his life, can ever forget the
compactness and force of his reasoning, the graphic power
of his illustration, and the wonderful effectiveness in his
application of truth to the conscience and the heart. He
had gathered into that series of seventy-five or one hundred
sermons the richest results of his life-thinking and
experience and had made most of them marvels of power.
This concentration of the whole force of the man on a few
sermons gives the evangelist great advantage in the pulpit
and would seem to be the dictate of true wisdom.</p>

<p>6. In his personal religious life the evangelist, while possessing
great helps, has a possible danger on the side of
spiritual pride. Moving constantly in the midst of revivals,
he is liable to forget that for the most part he is
simply reaping where other men have sown, and that conversion
is but the culminating point in a long series of
influences of which his was only the last; and in the
grateful affection of revived Christians and of converted
souls, which sometimes rises to spiritual adulation, he
may fail in that genuine humility which recognizes all
spiritual effects as the work of the Holy Spirit, and may
unconsciously assume an air of spiritual superiority painfully
in contrast with his obvious weaknesses. Power with
God is thus lost, and with it, power with men.</p>

<p>There is no ministerial office of higher responsibility
or greater usefulness than that of the evangelist. It has
<span class="pagenum" id="p134">[p.&nbsp;134]</span>
been filled by some of the noblest and ablest men in the
church of God&mdash;men &ldquo;full of the Holy Ghost and of faith,&rdquo;
whose names are fragrant in the memories of multitudes
as heralds of salvation. Ordinarily, only experienced men
should enter it; for it requires a purity and strength of
character, a soundness of judgment, and a largeness of
faith and patience, of practical wisdom and knowledge of
men, such as extended experience only will give.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">Second, Teachers.</span></p>

<p>The word &ldquo;teachers&rdquo; is employed in the New Testament
as the designation of men in churches whose
special work was public religious instruction. It is so
used 1&nbsp;Cor. xii.&nbsp;28&mdash;&ldquo;God hath set some in the church,
first Apostles, secondarily prophets, thirdly teachers&rdquo;&mdash;where
the word, while doubtless including evangelists and
pastors, evidently extends to all whose official work is
Christian teaching. Probably, also, in Eph. iv.&nbsp;11&mdash;&ldquo;He
gave some, Apostles, some, prophets, some, evangelists, and
some, pastors and teachers&rdquo;&mdash;the word has like breadth
of meaning, designating men not pastors who publicly
taught the Word. There are many endowed with teaching
power whose gifts the churches, according to New
Testament example, utilize in positions other than the
pastoral office. They are called to various departments
of work as secretaries and agents of missionary and benevolent
organizations, as instructors in institutions of
learning, as authors and editors engaged in creating and
diffusing a Christian literature, and as laborers in other
positions in which there is occasion for the exercise of
ministerial functions; and they are, therefore, often ordained
to preach and administer ordinances. On this
class of ministers, we submit the following remarks:</p>

<p>1. Teachers, like evangelists, have no official authority
<span class="pagenum" id="p135">[p.&nbsp;135]</span>
as governing officers in the church. They are members
with all the rights and duties of membership and differ
from others only as empowered to preach and to administer
ordinances. They are amenable, as others, to the
discipline of the church, except that those who have
received ordination through the action of a Council
should not be divested of the ministerial office except
by another Council. They have no right to ignore the
ordinary obligations of church membership in pecuniary
support, attendance on meetings, and personal
devotion to church-work, but rather, from their conspicuous
position, they are required to be in these things
examples and leaders in the church. 2.&nbsp;This class of
ministers in a church always stand in relations to the
pastor of peculiar delicacy. Though without official
authority, their character and gifts often give them great
influence in the church and in society. Much care,
therefore, should be used to avoid any intrusion on the
prerogatives of the pastor. For example, in marriages
and funerals within the bounds of his own church it is
ordinarily proper that the pastor should officiate; only
very unusual circumstances will justify a minister in
allowing himself to set aside the pastor in such services.
In the public and social worship of the church he should
beware of taking too prominent a place or of occupying
too much time, or of obtruding himself into the business
and discipline of the church in such manner as to embarrass
the pastor. In all relations in the church and
in social life he should accord the pastor the just precedence
which belongs to his official position, and his
influence should be scrupulously used to encourage the
pastor&rsquo;s work and strengthen the pastor&rsquo;s hands. Resident
ministers may thus become to the pastor a source, not of
discomfort and embarrassment, but of blessing and
<span class="pagenum" id="p136">[p.&nbsp;136]</span>
strength. 3.&nbsp;In the absence of the pressure of obligation
which a pastoral charge brings, the minister is in danger
of a secularized spirit, which weakens in him the sense
of spiritual realities and impairs his power in the public
ministration of the Gospel. To prevent this, he should
earnestly cultivate in his own soul the ministerial spirit
and should avoid all social or business entanglements
which may either militate against his own spiritual life
or may weaken his influence as a minister in the community.
The secretary or agent whose work calls him from
home has need of special care lest, in the constant changes
incident to travel, he loses habits of personal private devotion
and of biblical and theological study. It is possible
thus to retrograde in spiritual character and power, even
when pleading the holiest of causes. Indeed, in such
an itinerant life, the mind, thus in constant contact with
the churches and the ministry, may well be on its guard
lest it allow itself to be filled with the current ministerial
and church gossip, and yield to the temptation to pass
from church to church bearing this rather than &ldquo;the
fullness of the blessing of the Gospel of Christ.&rdquo; Few
positions afford such large opportunities to carry blessing
to pastors and churches as that of the secretary or agent
of our benevolent societies. In counselling the young or
the perplexed pastor, in healing divisions in churches and
removing misunderstandings between pastors and their
people, in inspiring and guiding the action of Associations
and other public bodies, their position gives them great
power, and opens before them a wide field for beneficent
influence. Such men were Alfred Bennett, John Peck, and
many others in the past&mdash;men whose presence was felt as a
benediction in the churches, and whose words gave everywhere
an impulse to the spiritual life; and such also are
many of those who now fill that responsible office.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p137">[p.&nbsp;137]</span>
<span class="smcap">Third, Licentiates.</span></p>

<p>There are many persons whose gifts qualify them for
usefulness in the occasional or the stated preaching of the
Word, but whose age or attainments or needs do not make
it expedient to ordain them. To such it is usual to give a
license, authorizing them to preach either within the bounds
of the church, or, more widely, wherever Providence may
open the door. This confers no authority to administer
ordinances; the only ministerial function it authorizes is
that of preaching and conducting public worship. Here
I suggest: 1.&nbsp;It is evident that such a license should be
given only with wise discrimination. A man of unsound
judgment, of defective knowledge of the Scriptures, or of
doubtful moral and religious character should never be
accredited as a preacher of the Gospel, however strong may
be his personal impressions of duty or attractive his address
in the eyes of the multitude. In the end he will be
likely to injure rather than aid the cause of religion. The
want of caution in hastily or thoughtlessly granting a license
has often resulted in introducing to the sacred office
men whose career has been calamitous to themselves and
to the churches. 2.&nbsp;No man should, ordinarily, venture to
preach without a license or some form of authorization
from the church. Every Christian, it is true, is required,
in his sphere, to publish the Gospel; but this surely does
not empower him to assume the office of the public ministry.
A call from God in the soul of the man is, it may
be admitted, the matter of prime moment in a call to
preach; but an inward impression of duty to preach certainly
gives no right to the ministerial function, unless it
be confirmed by the church, the Divinely-constituted judge
of qualification. To enter on the public work of the ministry
self-moved and self-appointed has no warrant in
<span class="pagenum" id="p138">[p.&nbsp;138]</span>
Scripture or in reason and is an act of assumption and
disorder which can only result in evil. 3.&nbsp;Churches and
pastors, while using a wise discretion, should carefully
seek out and develop ministerial gifts. Much power
doubtless remains latent which with proper care might
be developed and utilized in ministerial work. Many a
Christian life now left undeveloped, might be greatly enlarged
by being thus placed in its true sphere of activity;
and many a waste place within the bounds of our churches,
under the culture of a licentiate, might be made to glow
with spiritual life and beauty. It is surely one of the highest
duties of a church to recognize and make effective the
gifts Christ has bestowed on it; and among these none are
of greater moment than the gift of ministerial power.</p>

<h3 id="s17" class="tdc">SECTION XVII.</h3>

<p class="tdc">PASTORAL STUDY.</p>

<p>Study is an oft-repeated injunction on the Christian
ministry: &ldquo;Meditate upon these things: give thyself
wholly to them, that thy profiting may appear to all&rdquo;
(1&nbsp;Tim. iv.&nbsp;15); &ldquo;Study to show thyself approved unto
God, a workman that needeth not to be ashamed, rightly
dividing the word of truth&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;15). The reasons
for this are obvious. Knowledge is everywhere power.
The ministry, from their position, are the natural leaders
in religious thought. To command respect, they must be
men of mental grasp and activity, and must be in advance
of the thinking of those around them. Besides, no other
profession is so heavily tasked for brain exertion. The
Senate, the Bar, and the Platform only occasionally demand
the highest efforts of the intellect. But the pulpit
<span class="pagenum" id="p139">[p.&nbsp;139]</span>
requires weekly its elaborate sermons. They must have
freshness, originality, force, or the pastor loses his hold on
the people. And this exhaustive drain on his resources
continues steadily year after year. No man can meet such
demands without constant, earnest study. He must be
ever growing. His mental processes must be ceaselessly
active, pushing into new realms of investigation, gathering
new materials for thought, increasing his discipline, and
making him a broader, richer, deeper man.</p>

<p>In the life of a pastor two extremes are to be avoided.
On the one hand, he is not to be a mere book-worm, secluded
in his study, with no practical, living contact and
sympathy with life around him. Some ministers of large
literary culture have been comparatively useless from want
of living connection between their thinking and the real
needs of the busy actual world in which they lived. On
the other hand, a minister may not be a mere desultory
man, a gossip from house to house, occupied with newspapers
and magazines, skimming the surface of popular
thinking in ephemeral books that may attract his fancy,
but neglecting the severer processes of self-culture essential
to mental growth. Instability in the pastoral office is
often a result of this. Freshness, originality in thought
and expression, is lost, and the people, weary of repetitions
and empty platitudes, cease to respect and love the
pulpit. The grand object to be sought, then, is to combine
the student and the pastor&mdash;a mind growing in knowledge
and power by habitual work in the study and growing in
executive ability and social force by constant activity in
the church and contact with the people. To secure this
there must be a system&mdash;a system wisely formed and
steadily pursued. What shall this system be? In answering
this I propose to pursue two lines of suggestion&mdash;the
method of study and the subjects of study.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="pagenum" id="p140">[p.&nbsp;140]</span>
<span class="smcap">First, the Method.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Be a student everywhere.</i> The pastor&rsquo;s business is to deal
with the human mind and the actual experiences of men; he
should, therefore, go through the world with his eyes and
ears open, thoroughly studying men and life around him.
In the street, in society, in the social meeting, the mind
is to be ceaselessly at work, observing character, studying
phases of experience and life, and gathering materials for
mental work. Many of the best trains of thought, most interesting
views of Scripture, and most effective illustrations
will be suggested in conversations and in the prayer-room.
No man can afford to lose these; for, springing as they do
from direct contact with the people, such trains of thought
are most likely to meet the wants of the congregation and
deal with the questions most vital to them. The studious
pastor who preserves these texts and thoughts and illustrations
as they occur will be surprised to find how rapidly
they accumulate, and how fresh and rich they often render
his thinking and instruction.</p>

<p>2. <i>Have a book always on hand.</i> Every life has its spare
moments, and much may be added in culture and knowledge
by a right use of them. Most of the current literature
of the day, and much in standard biography, history,
science, poetry, and art can be read in this way, if the
right book is at hand. A half, or even a quarter, of an
hour each day will accomplish the reading of a large
number of volumes in a year; and if these are well
selected, they will greatly add to the minister&rsquo;s breadth
and intelligence, while they will refresh rather than
exhaust his mind.</p>

<p>3. <i>Consecrate a specific part of each day to severe systematic
work in the privacy of the study.</i> The habit of general
observation and reading, before suggested, can be no
<span class="pagenum" id="p141">[p.&nbsp;141]</span>
adequate substitute for this. The time thus appointed
for hard study should be sacredly devoted, and no ordinary
occurrence be allowed to interrupt. The advantages
of this are obvious. (1.)&nbsp;A habit once fixed is an ever-increasing
power. The mind acts with greater rapidity
and force when the habit of study at fixed, regularly
recurring periods is formed. Instead of spending hours
in vain attempts to fix attention and concentrate thought
on the subject in hand, the mind enters at once with full
energy into work. The more fixed and long continued
the habit, the more easy, rapid, and powerful the mental
processes. This is one secret of the immense amount of
brain-work performed by some men: by fixed habits
they instantly concentrate mental force, and work at
white heat. (2.)&nbsp;If these hours are once fixed, and are
fully understood by the people, they will ordinarily be
free from interruption. The congregation will conform
to the pastor&rsquo;s plan and will respect his fidelity in preparing
for their instruction on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. What
part of the day should be selected for the study cannot
be determined by any rule; it must depend partly on the
minister&rsquo;s habits, and partly on the necessities of his
position. Ordinarily, the morning is best. The liability
to interruption is less, and it leaves the afternoons and
evenings free for visitation, meetings, and social life.</p>

<p>Let me add, nothing but a high ideal of the ministry
and a fixed purpose to realize it will enable a pastor to
persist in such a course of study. He must believe in it
as a solemn duty he owes his God, his people and himself,
or he will fail. Indolence is often fostered by a false
dependence on genius or on the spur of the occasion to
give effectiveness and brilliancy to public utterances.
Unthoughtful hearers, also, will often praise the off-hand,
unstudied sermons and discourage elaborate preparation.
<span class="pagenum" id="p142">[p.&nbsp;142]</span>
Besides this, there are obstacles to study in the pastor&rsquo;s
work. He has cares connected with the sick, the afflicted,
the erring; executive work in the organization and discipline
of the church; and duties he owes society in the
varied relations of life. These are often pressing, and
the danger is that they crowd into the hours for study.
Many a man circumscribes his own intellectual growth
and pulpit power, making himself permanently a narrower
and weaker man, by allowing these outside cares to
destroy his processes of mental discipline and growth.
Here nothing will overcome but a profound conviction
that study&mdash;persistent, regular, life-long study&mdash;is the
solemn, first duty of every man who ventures to stand
up in the pulpit as an instructor of the people. Let
other duties have their place, but the first, the most
imperative duty of him who teaches others is to teach
himself.</p>

<p class="cgap"><span class="smcap">Second, the Subjects.</span></p>

<p>Let us suppose that the pastor has fixed his hours and
made them sacred to severe, thorough mental labor; what
shall he study? I answer: Not his sermons only. A grave
mistake is often made here. The whole time is devoted to
sermon preparation, leaving no room for general culture,
biblical investigation, or theological studies. As the
result, the mind becomes empty and barren. It lacks
material for thought. The man is perpetually pouring
out, but never pouring in, and the vessel becomes empty.
He faithfully grinds at the mill but puts nothing into
the hopper. Some conscientious, hardworking thinkers
in this way fail as preachers. They have no freshness.
The mind runs perpetually in the same grooves and moves
always in the same narrow circle, whereas, if they were
reading, investigating, looking on subjects from new standpoints
<span class="pagenum" id="p143">[p.&nbsp;143]</span>
and receiving the mental impulses which contact
with other thinkers gives, the mind would be ever growing,
ever enriching itself, and the sermons would be full
of fresh and interesting views of truth.</p>

<p>Three objects are to be sought in the study: general
culture, biblical and theological investigation, and sermon
preparation.</p>

<p class="cgap">I. <span class="smcap">General Culture.</span></p>

<p>By this I mean studies adapted to the development of
the whole man. The pastor is not to be, in the narrow,
technical sense, a mere theologian. He should seek to
be a man of broad culture, developing his nature on
every side and forming a full, symmetrical manhood.
To accomplish this his studies must take a wide range,
and open to him all those great realms of truth which
science, philosophy, poetry, and history reveal.</p>

<p>1. <i>The sciences.</i> The pastor should not, indeed, turn
aside from his sacred work to become a devotee to
science. But in this age of scientific investigation, when
the problems of science are so largely occupying public
thought and so vitally touching the profoundest questions
in religion, and the applications of science are so marvelously
transforming our whole civilization and life, surely,
at such a time, the man who stands up weekly to instruct
the people, assuming to lead public thought, ought not
to be ignorant of the results that science has reached,
although he may not stop to pursue the processes of
scientific inquiry. Astronomy, geology, botany, chemistry,
each open a new world of truth, pouring light on the
interpretation of God&rsquo;s Word and abounding in richest
illustrations of the sacred themes of the pulpit. Standard
works on these and related sciences are within the
reach of every pastor, and even one on each of them,
<span class="pagenum" id="p144">[p.&nbsp;144]</span>
carefully read, would greatly enrich and enlarge his
thinking.</p>

<p>2. <i>Philosophy, or the science of the mind.</i> The preacher undoubtedly
mistakes when he aspires to the character of
a philosopher, and turns aside from his direct and
earnest work for souls to lose himself in dialectics or the
mazes of metaphysical speculation. But his work as a
minister is to deal with the human soul&mdash;to influence the
mind by reasoning, by persuasion, by the array of
motives; and mind, therefore, in its power and the
methods of influencing it, may well constitute one of
his life-studies. It is here he comes in contact with the
master-spirits in the world of thought&mdash;minds which have
controlled the thinking of the ages&mdash;Plato and Aristotle,
Descartes and Bacon, Leibnitz and Locke. In the pressure
of a pastor&rsquo;s life all these cannot be read, but a few
choice, standard works on mental science, such as Hamilton,
Mansel, McCosh, and Porter, may surely be read and
carefully digested.</p>

<p>3. <i>&AElig;sthetic Culture.</i> God has not made us mere logical
machines, but beings of taste, imagination, sensibility, to
be moved by objects of beauty. Much of God&rsquo;s book is
in poetry addressed to the imagination, and the universe
around us is crowded with endless forms of the beautiful.
Where a cold, impassive logic fails, truth often comes with
resistless power through the imagination and the sensibilities.
The cultivation of this side of our nature is essential
to the development of a full manhood and is important
alike to pastoral and pulpit power. For this, one of
the best means is the careful reading of the greater poets,
the mighty creative minds whose works have stood the
test of ages. Among the last occupations of that magnificent
man, the late Dr. Wayland, was the re-reading of
Shakespeare and Milton; and these wonderful creations of
<span class="pagenum" id="p145">[p.&nbsp;145]</span>
genius afforded his ripened mind the richest instruction
and keenest enjoyment.</p>

<p>4. <i>History and general literature.</i> Historical study should,
without doubt, find no small place in this general culture.
It enlarges the whole range of thought, shedding light on
God&rsquo;s vast plan of providence and grace, and thus interpreting
the Bible; while in all its wide extent it is filled
with illustrations adapted to enforce the truths of the Gospel.
Nor should the higher class of works in fiction be
excluded, for they often have great value, both for their
delineations of character and life and for the culture they
give to the imagination.</p>

<p>Now, in respect to this general culture, the points I here
emphasize are, that it should be systematically and earnestly
prosecuted, and that on all the subjects studied only
the standard, thoroughly-tested authors should be read.
Such a plan of reading, steadily pursued year after year,
will make an ever-growing mind, developing symmetrically
on every side into a noble, intellectual manhood. It only
requires conscientious earnestness and persistency. The
time wasted by some ministers in mental dissipation over
newspapers and ephemeral literature would suffice to put
them into communion with those master-minds of the
ages, and secure the culture and wealth found in these
highest realms of thought.</p>

<p class="cgap">II. <span class="smcap">Biblical and Theological Culture.</span></p>

<p>The great work of a pastor is instruction in the truths
of the Bible; and wherever else he may fail, he must at
least be a master in the Gospel. Ignorance on some of
the topics already mentioned, though unfortunate, may
still be tolerated, but in the man who ventures into the
pulpit as a public instructor in the Bible, a want of biblical
knowledge and the utterance of crude, undiscriminating
<span class="pagenum" id="p146">[p.&nbsp;146]</span>
statements of truth can never be excused. No mere
rhetorical power or seeming earnestness can atone for a
want of thorough mastery of the themes of the pulpit.
Biblical and theological investigation should, therefore,
have a large place in the pastor&rsquo;s plan of study.</p>

<p>1. <i>Here, first of all, and most important, is the direct study
of the Bible, bringing the mind into living contact with God&rsquo;s
Word.</i> As students in the Hebrew and Greek, let a part of
each day be given to careful, critical study of the Scriptures
in the Divine originals as they were indited by the
Holy Spirit. No translation, however perfect, can possibly
give one the whole impression of the original. A little
careful work each day in reading the original Scriptures
will soon make the process easy and delightful, and its
value is above all price. But, whether in the inspired
original or in a version, the Bible should be carefully studied.
It is God&rsquo;s own Word, the great instrument of His
power, &ldquo;the sword of the Spirit.&rdquo; The Holy Spirit works
only through Divine truth, and that must ever be the
mightiest pulpit which most fully and clearly unfolds
these living words of God. (1.)&nbsp;As accessory to biblical
interpretation, I suggest the study of the geography and
history of Bible lands. The power to localize the characters
and events of Scripture and place them in their historical
surroundings is of the highest importance. Thus,
in reading the Pentateuch and earlier historical books, how
much more vividly are the events conceived if you are familiar
with the localities in Egypt, the desert, and Palestine;
or in reading Ezra, Nehemiah, and Daniel if you
have clear ideas of the place and history of Assyria and
Babylon; or in the New Testament if you have studied
the condition and localities of the Roman Empire, then
dominant! For this such works as Smith&rsquo;s <i>Old and New
Testament History,</i> Rawlinson&rsquo;s <i>Five Ancient Monarchies,</i> and
<span class="pagenum" id="p147">[p.&nbsp;147]</span>
Milman&rsquo;s <i>History of the Jews</i> or Stanley&rsquo;s <i>Jewish Church,</i>
would furnish the historical information, while a good
biblical atlas, kept always open before you, would give the
needed maps. Full historical and topographical discussions
will be found in Smith&rsquo;s <i>Bible Dictionary,</i> Robinson&rsquo;s
<i>Biblical Researches,</i> or Thompson&rsquo;s <i>Land and the Book.</i>
(2.)&nbsp;The Bible, I also suggest, should be studied in its unity.
The book of God, from Genesis to Revelation, is one whole,
from first to last unfolding, by successive steps, one system
of truth and method of redemption. It is not a mere fortuitous
collection of sacred writings, but one grand revelation
from God, each part related to every other and essential
to the whole. The types and prophecies and symbols
of the earlier Scriptures contain the germs of the later
Gospel, and no man will thoroughly understand the one
Testament without a careful study of the other. This interior,
vital unity in the several parts of Scripture is developed
in such works as Fairbairn&rsquo;s <i>Typology</i> and the <i>Philosophy
of the Plan of Salvation.</i> (3.)&nbsp;The books of the Bible
should be studied in their chronological and historical
connection. Suppose one is studying the prophecy of
Isaiah: he will ascertain its meaning far more clearly if
he have carefully studied the period when Isaiah lived,
the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah as given
in Kings and Chronicles. Or suppose he is reading the
Epistles of Paul: their interpretation will be far more clear
if he have studied the character of Paul and the circumstances
under which he wrote as they are developed in the
Acts and the Epistles, aided by such a work as Conybeare
and Howson&rsquo;s <i>Life and Epistles of St. Paul.</i> (4.)&nbsp;The Bible
should also be studied analytically. A cursory reading of
the Scriptures does not interpret them; they must be carefully
analyzed if one would penetrate into their full meaning.
For example, one is reading Romans; he begins,
<span class="pagenum" id="p148">[p.&nbsp;148]</span>
&ldquo;Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, called to be an Apostle,
separated unto the Gospel of God, which He had promised
before by His prophets in holy Scripture, concerning His
Son, Jesus Christ, our Lord; who was made of the seed of
David according to the flesh, but declared to be the Son of
God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness, by the
resurrection from the dead.&rdquo; Now analyze or extract the
propositions here contained. It is affirmed here of Paul,
1.&nbsp;That he is a servant (<span lang="grc-Latn">doulos</span>) of Jesus Christ; 2.&nbsp;That
he is a Divinely-called Apostle; 3.&nbsp;That as an Apostle he is
set apart unto the Gospel of God. It is said of the Gospel,
1.&nbsp;That it was foreannounced by the prophets in Holy
Scripture; 2.&nbsp;That its subject-matter is concerning Jesus
Christ our Lord. It is declared of Christ, 1.&nbsp;That as to
His flesh, or human nature, He descended from David;
2.&nbsp;That as to His spirit of holiness, or Divine nature, He was
clearly shown to be the Son of God by the fact of His resurrection.
Now, the man who will patiently, steadily work
out such an analysis of God&rsquo;s Word as he studies it will
penetrate the heart of it, and its richness will astonish him.
The great thoughts of God will be laid open to his view as
they never can be to the careless, superficial reader; and
if, with such biblical work in the study, the pastor devotes
a part of the Lord&rsquo;s Day either to expository preaching or
to a lecture in his Bible school, this direct connection of
the work of the study with that of the pulpit will add
interest and force to both.</p>

<p>2. <i>In the study of the Christian doctrines it is, first of all,
important to have a system.</i> This plan of work should be
so arranged that in a course of years, taking one subject at
a time, the pastor may make a thorough investigation of
all the leading topics. As the basis take such a work as
Hodge&rsquo;s <i>Outline of Theology,</i> or any good compendium of
theology, and, following the order of subjects, work in each
<span class="pagenum" id="p149">[p.&nbsp;149]</span>
until its main points have been mastered. For illustration,
suppose the subject is the doctrine of inspiration.
First work out carefully the questions in your chosen
text-book, and read some of the best authors on the subject,
as Lee, Woods, Gaussen, and Hodge. All the points
involved will thus be brought distinctly before the mind.
Then collect the leading passages of Scripture bearing
on it and examine each critically and patiently and
note down your own impressions. Follow this by writing
a full and careful statement of your own view as the
result of the investigation. Or suppose the subject to be
that great central doctrine of the Gospel, the atonement.
After working out the questions as presented in your text-book
and reading the best authors accessible to you, so as
to become master of the vital points, then examine the
priesthood and sacrifices of the Old Testament, the predictions
of the atonement in prophecy, and the passages
bearing on this doctrine in the New Testament. Having
thus before you the elements of a decision, write out fully
your own view. Such a process of theological investigation,
steadily pressed year after year, and connected as it
would be with the reading of the great masters in theology,
could not fail to make the pastor a clear, strong religious
thinker and his pulpit a power in leading religious
thought. Let me also urge the study of the history of
doctrines in connection with such a course of theological
investigation. Take such a work as Hagenbach&rsquo;s or
Shedd&rsquo;s <i>History of Doctrines,</i> in which the course of theological
thinking on each of the great truths of the Bible
is traced through the ages, and the varying phases of the
doctrine through successive periods, and the forms in
which it has been held by the world&rsquo;s profoundest thinkers
are presented. Such a study is wonderfully stimulating
to thought and affords a broader basis for the formation
<span class="pagenum" id="p150">[p.&nbsp;150]</span>
of opinions. If also, in direct connection with this
investigation of a great truth, the pastor should preach on
the leading points involved in it, he would greatly add to
the definiteness of his own views, while the work of the
study would thus come into the work of the pulpit, enhancing
the interest and power of the sermons.</p>

<p class="cgap">III. <span class="smcap">Sermon Preparation.</span></p>

<p><i>The preparation of sermons should doubtless fill the chief
place in these hours of private study.</i> This subject, however,
belongs to the department of homiletics, and will be
found amply treated in works specially devoted to it,
such as Broadus on the <i>Preparation and Delivery of Sermons,</i>
Shedd&rsquo;s <i>Homiletic and Pastoral Theology,</i> and the
several courses of <i>Yale Lectures on Preaching.</i> I will,
therefore, on this topic only emphasize the importance
of high ideals of sermonizing and pulpit preparation.</p>

<p>The sermon is the embodied result of the pastor&rsquo;s culture
and reading, the public expression of his whole
spiritual and intellectual manhood, and he is bound to
show himself &ldquo;a workman who needeth not to be ashamed,
rightly dividing the word of truth&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim. ii.&nbsp;15). He
dishonors Christ and His Gospel if he habitually preaches
without thorough study.</p>

<p>The sermon is the message God sends by him to the
people. It unfolds high and holy themes, into which
&ldquo;angels desire to look,&rdquo; and on which the profoundest
minds of the ages have dwelt with wonder and awe. It
deals with the souls of men and the great interests of
eternity. Surely, the man who ventures to stand up and
speak carelessly and thoughtlessly on such themes and
amidst such interests has failed to grasp the primary
idea of his great office as a Christian pastor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="p151">[p.&nbsp;151]</span></p>
<h3 id="s18" class="tdc">SECTION XVIII.</h3>

<p class="tdc">PASTORAL RESPONSIBILITY.</p>

<p>The pastor, in a true and important sense, is entrusted
with the care of the souls of his congregation; he is, therefore,
under obligation to use his utmost power for their
conversion and sanctification, &ldquo;warning every man and
teaching every man,&rdquo; that he &ldquo;may present every man
perfect in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Col. i.&nbsp;28). Paul said to the
Ephesian elders: &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves, and to all the
flock over the which the Holy Ghost has made you overseers,
to feed the church of God, which He has purchased
with His own blood&rdquo; (Acts xx.&nbsp;28); and in exhorting the
people on their part to obey the ministry, he urges as a
reason, &ldquo;for they watch for your souls as they that must
give account&rdquo; (Heb. xiii.&nbsp;17). This responsibility plainly
includes: 1.&nbsp;<i>A personal life such that it may constitute a fitting
example.</i> The pastor is to be &ldquo;an example of the believers
in word, in conversation, in charity, in spirit, in faith, in
purity&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim iv.&nbsp;12). Thus, Paul ever referred to his
own life, not as perfect, but as publicly exemplifying the
Christian character, saying to the Philippians (Phil. iv.&nbsp;9):
&ldquo;Those things which ye have both learned and received,
and heard, and seen in me, do; and the God of peace
shall be with you;&rdquo; and to the Thessalonians (1&nbsp;Thess. ii.&nbsp;10),
&ldquo;Ye are witnesses, and God also, how holily and justly
and unblameably we behaved ourselves among you that
believe.&rdquo; A defective, irregular life in the pastor neutralizes
the ablest efforts in the pulpit and may become a pre-eminent
means of the ruin of souls. 2.&nbsp;<i>Wise and faithful
dealing with the individual souls of his charge.</i> Paul went
&ldquo;from house to house,&rdquo; from soul to soul: he &ldquo;ceased not
to warn every one night and day with tears,&rdquo; and he proposes
<span class="pagenum" id="p152">[p.&nbsp;152]</span>
this as an example of ministerial fidelity, requiring
the pastor to be &ldquo;instant in season, out of season.&rdquo; Evidently,
he did not regard the work of the minister as done
when performed only in the study and the pulpit: it included
personal dealing with souls. 3.&nbsp;<i>Earnest effort to
become an able minister of the New Testament.</i> The most
solemn urgencies press on the pastor the duty of seeking
the highest possible intellectual and pulpit power. The
themes he unfolds are the grandest that can engage the
thought of man or angel. The end to be secured&mdash;the salvation
of souls&mdash;is the most momentous ever committed
to a finite being. God will not hold guiltless the indolent,
reckless minister who causes the Gospel to be despised
and imperils the souls of his people by a careless, unstudied
presentation of the message He has entrusted to
him. 4.&nbsp;<i>The faithful declaration of the whole counsel of God.</i>
He is to show distinctly the threatenings as well as the
promises of the Gospel, and the danger as well as the
hopes set before the soul. No subject is to be avoided
because unpopular or distasteful. No personal considerations
are to prevent the plain, distinct enunciation of all
the words of God. Jehovah says to the watchman: &ldquo;If
thou dost not speak to warn the wicked from his way,
that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood
will I require at thine hand&rdquo; (Ezek. xxxiii.&nbsp;8; iii.&nbsp;17&ndash;21).</p>

<p>Pastoral responsibility, however, has its limitation.
Christ does not require of His servants impossible labor;
but as they have received their talents, so they are to use
them, each &ldquo;according to his several ability.&rdquo; If faithful
to his trust, the pastor is &ldquo;unto God a sweet savor of Christ,
in them that are saved, and in them that perish&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor.
ii.&nbsp;15&ndash;17), and it is his right to feel he has &ldquo;delivered
his soul&rdquo; and is &ldquo;pure from the blood of all men&rdquo; (Acts
xx.&nbsp;26, 27). Such was the ministry of Paul, a mere man,
<span class="pagenum" id="p153">[p.&nbsp;153]</span>
aided in this only by such Divine help as is promised to
every other servant of God. It is fidelity, not success,
which constitutes the limit of responsibility. Success belongs
to God. Paul plants, Apollos waters, but God gives
the increase. Jeremiah spoke with the earnestness and
tenderness of lips inspired, but he was unpopular, and, as
men would measure, unsuccessful; nevertheless, his name
stands high among the ancient worthies, because in that
degenerate age he was faithful to his trust and work.
Besides, a minister&rsquo;s power is not measured by the immediate,
outward result. The powerful revival in which
hundreds are gathered into the church finds its occasion,
indeed, in the peculiar gifts of some popular preacher,
but its real causes often lie hid in the quiet, patient toil
of other men differently gifted. Every man has his special
adaptation and work&mdash;one sows and another reaps&mdash;and
only in the great harvest at the end of the world will the
actual results of each man&rsquo;s work appear. Hence, Christ
says to every servant of His: &ldquo;Be thou <i>faithful</i> unto death,
and I will give thee a crown of life&rdquo; (Rev. ii.&nbsp;10). Fidelity,
then, is the limit of responsibility; and the earnest
pastor, who, with heartfelt loyalty to Christ, has to the extent
of his ability and opportunity faithfully fulfilled his
calling, may know assuredly that he has the approval of
the Master, and that awaiting him at the end is the sure
reward of the faithful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s19" class="tdc">SECTION XIX.</h3>

<p class="tdc">THE OUTER LIFE OF A PASTOR.</p>

<p>The Scriptures require in the pastor a model life. He
is to be &ldquo;an example of the believers, in word, in conversation,
in charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim.
<span class="pagenum" id="p154">[p.&nbsp;154]</span>
iv.&nbsp;12). As the leader of the flock his outward life will
be expected to evince a higher moral tone and furnish a
more marked exemplification of Christian principles than
that of the private Christian, because his office constitutes
him an example, and the prominence of his position renders
defects in him especially conspicuous and hurtful.
Hence, Scripture is here explicit and emphatic: &ldquo;A
bishop, then, must be blameless, the husband of one
wife, vigilant, sober, of good behavior, given to hospitality,
apt to teach: not given to wine, no striker, not
greedy of filthy lucre; but patient, not a brawler, not
covetous; one that ruleth well his own house, having his
children in subjection with all gravity (for if a man
know not how to rule his own house, how shall he take
care of the church of God?): not a novice, lest being
lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the
devil. Moreover, he must have a good report of them
that are without, lest he fall into reproach and the snare
of the devil&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim. iii.&nbsp;2&ndash;7).</p>

<p class="cgap">I. <span class="smcap">Business Relations.</span></p>

<p>1. <i>Make no debts:</i> &ldquo;Owe no man anything&rdquo; (Rom. xiii.&nbsp;8).
In all purchases for personal and family purposes the
pastor should pay as he buys. It cultivates a just economy
and avoids debts, which often prove a heavy burden
on a minister&rsquo;s life and a most serious drawback to his
usefulness. No man is thoroughly independent in the
pulpit who is facing a number of unpaid creditors. Ordinarily,
this avoidance of debt is entirely feasible, and
when understood to be a rule with the pastor it has a
beneficial influence in promoting promptness in the payment
of his salary. The people will respect such a course in
their minister. At the very outset of life, then, let him fix
it as a principle never to run in debt. A strict adherence to
<span class="pagenum" id="p155">[p.&nbsp;155]</span>
this will sometimes involve inconvenience and self-denial,
but these are more than compensated in the exemption
from the anxieties and humiliations of debt, in the
sense of independence, in the respect and confidence of
the community, and, above all, in the clear conscience
which observance of this rule secures. Only the most
absolute necessity should ever set aside this rule, for the
neglect of this is too frequently a cause of failure in the
pastoral office.</p>

<p>2. <i>Use great care and all the proper forms in making
business engagements.</i> The pastor is tempted to neglect
business forms on the supposition that as a minister he
ought to rely on the honor and consideration of those
with whom he deals, and as the result, even where there
is no dishonesty, there is often misunderstanding, out of
which grow heartburnings and disputes. All business
transactions, therefore, should be conducted in a business
way, leaving no room for misapprehensions, and then all
engagements should be met with promptness and honor.
A pastor should be delicately sensitive to his reputation
in this, for any failure, though it be only an apparent
one, in fulfilling a business obligation is sure to provoke
unfavorable comment and militate against usefulness.</p>

<p>3. <i>Live within your income.</i> A pastor may not be
reckless in regard to the probable future needs of himself
and of those dependent on him. Such a course is
justified neither by Scripture nor by Providence. &ldquo;The
Lord ordained that they who preach the Gospel should
live of the Gospel&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. ix.&nbsp;14). A minister, therefore,
should find a life-support in his income from his work,
and should so use his salary that a part be laid aside for
coming days of need. If the salary is small, he should rigidly
cut down expenses that some of it may be reserved.
Special exigencies in life, will, indeed, sometimes prevent
<span class="pagenum" id="p156">[p.&nbsp;156]</span>
this, but ordinarily it is feasible, and in the case of the
head of a family it is plainly a most sacred duty. The
neglect of care to make provision for those dependent on
us is not faith, but recklessness.</p>

<p>Here, however, a pastor must beware of covetousness.
Instances sometimes occur in which this just and necessary
regard for future need degenerates into a selfish greed
for accumulation which narrows and belittles the minister
of Christ. He compromises his dignity and independence
by seeking in various ways gifts from his people, and
thus the man is sunk in the mendicant, or he degrades
his office by descending to petty meannesses, driving close
bargains in business and shirking his just share in the
contributions for church-work and benevolence. Nowhere
is the love of money more offensive than in the
Christian minister.</p>

<p class="cgap">II. <span class="smcap">Political Relations.</span></p>

<p>1. A pastor should always himself exercise the elective
franchise and should encourage Christians to do so;
in no other way can we have a Christian government.
On this continent the great experiment is in progress of
a government strictly by the people, and in the absence
of religion and virtue it must prove a failure. Christian
men should not neglect their duties as citizens; it imperils
the life of the nation and the welfare of the Christian
cause. The pulpit, therefore, should press on the church
the duty of seeking the elevation of good men to official
station. 2.&nbsp;As a pastor the minister is bound to refuse
all party obligations and all partisan use of pastoral influence;
for he is pastor of the whole church, chosen and
supported without reference to political distinctions
among the members. But as an individual he is
entitled to his political preferences and his just political
<span class="pagenum" id="p157">[p.&nbsp;157]</span>
influence; with this the church has no right to interfere.
At the same time, it is wise for the pastor to avoid excited
political discussions, especially in public places, and
quietly to exercise his political rights and perform the duties
of a citizen. 3.&nbsp;When public questions have a strictly
moral side, I think the pulpit should not be silent, but
should seek, as on moral questions in general, to give
direction to public sentiment in favor of honesty, truth,
and virtue. Occasional sermons, therefore, presenting the
obligations of citizens and applying the moral teachings
of Christianity to questions on which Christian citizens
are called to act, are the duty of the pastor; but the time
and manner and spirit of such sermons require the exercise
of the most careful judgment.</p>

<p class="cgap">III. <span class="smcap">Social Character and Relations.</span></p>

<p>Two extremes are here to be avoided&mdash;the one, in which
the pastor lives a recluse life, isolated from the life of the
people and unfelt in directing the currents of thought
and feeling around him; the other, in which he maintains
a loose, familiar intercourse with all society, lounging
about in public places, a &ldquo;hail-fellow-well-met&rdquo;
with everybody. Avoiding these extremes, a pastor
should never allow himself to be a cipher in social life
but should make himself a vital force controlling and
elevating it. The gravity of his character and work,
however, requires him to use special care in regard to
deportment and associations. He is, indeed, to be and to
act out himself, but, while true to his own nature as a man,
he is so to control it as never to forget his character and
office as a minister of God. Here I offer the following
suggestions:</p>

<p>1. The minister should be, always and everywhere, the
unaffected Christian gentleman, showing all courtesy to
<span class="pagenum" id="p158">[p.&nbsp;158]</span>
all men. It is here some fail, and either through a
neglect of the courtesies and amenities of social life
render themselves repulsive, or by a stiff and artificial
manner of observing them, without geniality and warmth,
make themselves unapproachable. Men ordinarily and
justly regard manners as an index of character. Good
manners, therefore, cannot be put on from without; they
spring from a sense of the relations we bear to others and
a disposition to act in accordance with them. A kindly,
unselfish heart, a quick, keen sympathy, a sensitive
regard for others&rsquo; rights and feelings; a ready, generous
appreciation for the excellences of others, and a tender
charity for their faults and foibles&mdash;in short, a well-developed
Christian manhood, with refined sensibilities,
noble, pure, upright, transparent, touching life on every
side, and fitted to bless whatever it touches,&mdash;this is
the only real basis of correct manners. The cultivation
of such a character, therefore, is the prime necessity, for
in this will exist all the instincts of the true gentleman
from which the gentlemanly manner spontaneously results.</p>

<p>2. In the matter of dress. I do not know that any law of
propriety requires the minister to be distinguished either
in the cut or the color of his garments. Many, however,
prefer some kind of ministerial costume as a matter of
convenience to indicate everywhere their vocation, and
this is, of course, a subject to be left wholly to individual
preference. The principle to be insisted on as important
is that the dress be not such as to arrest special attention,
as suggesting foppishness and fastidiousness on the one
hand, or carelessness and slovenliness on the other. The
man, not the dress, should arrest and hold attention.</p>

<p>3. In conversation he should be genial, courteous,
affable, avoiding that tone and manner of condescension
which carries in it an implied sense of superiority, and
<span class="pagenum" id="p159">[p.&nbsp;159]</span>
exhibiting that breadth of intelligence and culture which
will secure respect for his views in general society. Slang
phrases, vulgar anecdotes, boisterous discussions, idle
gossip, and scandal, it is hardly necessary to say, ill become
a pastor, and will in the end seriously militate
against his usefulness. Coarseness, indelicacy, and all
that is suggestive of impurity should be scrupulously
avoided; such words, when uttered by a minister, live
and fester in the memory, and are destructive of all
pastoral influence afterward over those who hear them.
&ldquo;An obscene story, a lewd double <span lang="fr">entendre,</span> a filthy joke,
a questionable word or gesture, a sentence that would
make a pure woman blush in public or in private, in select
or in mixed company, is a burning shame and scandal
to any minister of the Gospel.&rdquo; Nor should his chief
distinction in society be that of the wit or mimic. Wit
and humor, when natural, are often elements of real
power, as giving sparkle and flavor to speech, but in
the pastor their place is subordinate; when they appear
as his chief characteristic, they inevitably injure his
influence. Attractive social qualities, such as enable the
pastor to exercise a leading and governing power in
society, are to be most earnestly sought; their effect on
pastoral usefulness can hardly be overstated.</p>

<p>The minister, when a guest, enjoying the temporary hospitality
of a family circle, should bring into it the blessing
of a genial, sunshiny spirit, showing always a thorough
appreciation of kindness received and avoiding all unnecessary
trouble to the hosts. If other ministers are
present, beware of that ministerial clannishness which
centers conversation on topics adapted only to ministers
or makes it consist of ministerial criticism, gossip, and
scandal adapted to lower the estimation in which other
ministers are held. In the freedom and <i>abandon</i> of ministerial
<span class="pagenum" id="p160">[p.&nbsp;160]</span>
society there is often much temptation to this, but
words thus thoughtlessly spoken sometimes do incalculable
injury, both by lowering the ministerial character in the
eyes of the household, and by inflicting an incurable
wound on the reputation of those made the subjects of
gossip. The injunction of Scripture cannot be too carefully
heeded: &ldquo;Let your speech be always with grace,
seasoned with salt&rdquo; (Col. iv.&nbsp;6); for thus the spirit you
breathed and the words you spake will remain a benediction
with that household and make your memory fragrant
there for ever.</p>

<p>4. In his amusements and recreations a pastor should
indulge only in such as are not only in themselves innocent
but are not commonly offensive to the Christian conscience.
The grand principle of self-denial enunciated by
Paul as the rule of his own life is here, undoubtedly, the
guiding principle of ministerial duty. He says: &ldquo;Give
none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor
to the church of God: even as I please all men in all
things, not seeking mine own profit, but the profit of
many, that they may be saved&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. x.&nbsp;32, 33). He
relinquished self-gratification, even though innocent, rather
than put a cause of stumbling before others and hinder
their salvation. Recreation is doubtless a necessity&mdash;the
bow always bent loses its spring&mdash;but recreation should
never be taken in a form which may give offence to Christian
souls, or which may set an example such as, if followed
by others, might work their injury. A pastor&rsquo;s influence
also may be impaired by undue absorption in any
form of recreation. There is no wrong, it may be, in using
a good horse, in playing a game of ball or croquet, in fishing
or hunting, or many other forms of recreation; but the
pastor who is specially distinguished for his interest in fast
horses or for his sporting habits, or as a devotee of amusements,
<span class="pagenum" id="p161">[p.&nbsp;161]</span>
violates most seriously the proprieties of his position,
and sinks in the estimation of all thoughtful people.</p>

<p>5. A minister&rsquo;s associations or special intimacies should
not be with bad or loose or irreligious men; the taint will
necessarily tarnish and injure his own reputation, even if
it does not corrupt his character. He is to be &ldquo;a lover of
good men, sober, just, holy, temperate&rdquo; (Tit. i.&nbsp;8). He
should show all courtesy and kindness, indeed, to even the
worst men around him, but his special friendships should
not be sought there, nor his habitual associations. Some
ministers have here made wreck of their influence with
the better classes in the community, while their association
with the loose and irreligious class, so far from winning them
to Christ, has only the more hardened them in rejecting Him
by lowering in their eyes the character of His servant.</p>

<p>6. The pastor&rsquo;s relations with the other sex should not
only always be pure in fact but should also be such as to
avoid even the possibility of misconstruction. No point
needs to be more carefully guarded, for even the suspicion
or thought of wrong in this, however ill-grounded, is commonly
fatal to usefulness, and often follows him through
the remainder of life.</p>

<p class="cgap">IV. <span class="smcap">Personal Habits.</span></p>

<p>The pastor is expected to be a model Christian gentleman,
showing the refinement, delicacy, and culture which
the Gospel inculcates and produces, and improper habits,
therefore, in him are more prominent and influential
for evil than in other men. Now and then a minister exhibits
a foolish <i>bravado</i> of public opinion by affecting
brusque, uncouth, eccentric manners and indulging in
questionable habits under the mistaken supposition that,
in thus setting at defiance the common sentiments of
mankind in regard to the proprieties of ministerial life,
<span class="pagenum" id="p162">[p.&nbsp;162]</span>
he is showing moral courage and manhood; nor are there
wanting equally foolish people who will applaud this contemptible
exhibition of personal vanity. But, apart from
such exceptional cases, the ministerial life is always beset
by strong temptations to unbecoming habits. Thus:</p>

<p>1. <i>Intemperance in eating.</i> The studious life, as ordinarily
pursued, often tends to dyspepsia and an unnatural
craving for food. The bodily and mental vigor is often
thus destroyed, while the obvious absence of self-restraint
degrades the man in the eyes of others. The dullness of
the pulpit and the ill-health of ministers are not seldom
traceable to an overloaded stomach.</p>

<p>2. <i>The use of tobacco.</i> The highest medical authorities
now agree that this is one of the common causes of nervous
prostration and early mental decay. The late Prof. Moses
Stuart says: &ldquo;I do not place the use of tobacco in the
same scale with that of ardent spirits. It does not make
men maniacs or demons. But that it does undermine
the health of thousands; that it creates a nervous irritability,
and thus operates on the temper and moral character
of men; that it often creates a thirst for spirituous
liquors; that it allures to clubs and grog-shops and taverns,
and thus helps to make idlers and spendthrifts; and
finally, that it is a very serious and needless expense,&mdash;are
things which cannot be denied by any observing and considerate
person. And if all this be true, how can the
habitual use of tobacco as a mere luxury be defended by
any one who wishes well to his fellow-men or has a proper
regard to his own usefulness?&rdquo; The duty of self-conquest
in regard to such a habit is evident especially in the
minister, whose very office adds emphasis to his personal
example; and the principle involved is strongly set forth
by Paul when he says: &ldquo;All things are lawful for me,
but <i>I will not be brought under the power of any</i>&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. vi.&nbsp;12).
<span class="pagenum" id="p163">[p.&nbsp;163]</span>
He accounted it an unworthy and dangerous thing
for a Christian to come under bondage to any bodily appetite.
But he adds: &ldquo;Every man that striveth for the mastery
is temperate in all things: now they do it to obtain a corruptible
crown; but we, an incorruptible. I therefore so
run, not as uncertainly; so fight I, not as one that beateth
the air: but I keep under my body, and bring it into subjection:
lest by any means when I have preached to others,
I myself should be a cast-away&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. ix.&nbsp;25&ndash;27).</p>

<p>3. <i>The use of stimulants.</i> The pressure of intellectual
work on the pastor often requires of him the most important
public efforts when worn and depressed, and thus
at times the temptation to stimulate is very strong. The
fact of bodily weakness pleads for a stimulant as a medical
necessity. Once indulged, stimulation readily passes
into a habit, and the importance of the occasion is made
an effectual plea for it as an alternative to failure. Now,
in all such cases, the consciousness of self-indulgence, as
it weakens self-respect, must needs also weaken the moral
power of the minister. He feels himself enslaved and
cannot speak with authority. While consciously and deliberately
yielding to self-indulgence, how can he preach
to others the moral teachings of the Gospel? Such an
indulgence, moreover, places the man in fearful peril,
for it creates the necessity of repetition, and forms an
appetite which in many instances has destroyed the man.
Some of the most brilliant men in the ministry have here
made an utter and terrible wreck of life.</p>

<p>Right habits are, therefore, of primary moment. A
man can respect himself and secure the respect of others
only as he exercises habitual self-control, holding passion
and appetite in thorough subjection; without this the
pastor lacks that consciousness of independence and that
true manhood in which alone resides genuine moral power;
<span class="pagenum" id="p164">[p.&nbsp;164]</span>
and his defects, made conspicuous and influential by his
sacred office, may be disastrous in their influence on those
around him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="s20" class="tdc">SECTION XX.</h3>

<p class="tdc">THE PASTOR&rsquo;S INNER LIFE.</p>

<p>Ancient asceticism, in demanding for the ministry a
hidden life of communion with God, gave voice not only
to one of the profoundest intuitions of the Christian consciousness,
but also to one of the clearest teachings of
Scripture. The men who deal with spiritual things must
themselves be spiritual. Our age, while rightly rejecting a
perverted asceticism, is tending to the opposite error. It
is intensely practical. &ldquo;Action!&rdquo; is its watchword. This
practicalness often becomes mere narrowness and shallowness.
It overlooks the profounder laws of the Christian
life. Spiritual force comes from within, from the hidden
life of God in the soul. It depends, not on mere outward
activities, but on the Divine energies acting through the
human faculties, God working through the man, the
Holy Ghost permeating, quickening all the powers of the
preacher, and speaking by his voice to the souls of the
people. The soul&rsquo;s secret power with God thus gives
public power with men, and the mightiest influences of
the pulpit often flow from a hidden spring in the solitude
of the closet; for a sermon is not the mere utterance of
man: there is in it a power more than human. Its vital
force comes from the Holy Spirit. Jesus said: &ldquo;It is not
<i>ye</i> that speak, but the Spirit of your Father that speaketh
in you&rdquo; (Matt. x.&nbsp;20). Its spiritual energy springs from
something deeper than logic and rhetoric. As Bushnell
has well said: &ldquo;Preaching is nothing else than the bursting
<span class="pagenum" id="p165">[p.&nbsp;165]</span>
out of life which has first burst in or up from where
God is among the soul&rsquo;s foundations.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Such was the teaching of Christ. In His farewell words
to His disciples He promised &ldquo;another Comforter&rdquo;&mdash;one
who should take His place among them and abide with
them for ever. As He had walked with them an Instructor,
Friend, Helper, so after His departure the Holy
Spirit should dwell among them, teaching, inspiring,
guiding them, a true and living Divine Presence ever with
them and mighty to help. Blessed as His own bodily presence
had been, the presence of the Holy Spirit was of still
higher moment, for He declared that it was better for
them that He Himself depart and the Spirit come; for
the Spirit, whose office it is to take of Christ and show
Him, should reveal the Christ-presence within them in
accordance with His promise: &ldquo;He that loveth Me shall
be loved of My Father, and I will love him, and <i>will
manifest Myself to him</i>&rdquo; (John xiv.&nbsp;21); &ldquo;I will not
leave you comfortless; <i>I will come to you</i>&rdquo; (John xiv.&nbsp;18).
Without this Divine Helper He expressly forbade their
entrance on the ministry, and as His last charge before He
ascended He said, &ldquo;Tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until
ye be endued with power from on high&rdquo; (Luke xxiv.&nbsp;49).</p>

<p>At the Pentecost the Holy Spirit descended, and how
marvelous was His power! Plain as had been the words
Jesus spake, the apostles yet utterly misconceived the most
vital truths; but when the Spirit of truth came, the Gospel,
in its grandeur and power, stood clearly revealed before
them. The men who before had timidly cowered in the
presence of danger now rejoiced that they &ldquo;were counted
worthy to suffer shame&rdquo; for the name of the Lord Jesus
(Acts v.&nbsp;41). They whose selfish ambition had aspired to
be &ldquo;greatest in the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; now forgot their
mean rivalries, and were inspired with single-hearted
<span class="pagenum" id="p166">[p.&nbsp;166]</span>
consecration to the Master; and the multitudes who before
had despised and rejected their words, now convicted
&ldquo;of sin, of righteousness, and of judgment,&rdquo; bowed
before this unseen, mighty Power, and cried out, &ldquo;Men
and brethren, what must we do?&rdquo; (Acts ii.&nbsp;37).</p>

<p>Now, it is plain that the Holy Spirit, this special &ldquo;power
from on high,&rdquo; was promised, not to the Apostles only, but
to the ministry in all ages. In the New Testament period
He dwelt, a living, quickening Divine presence, in all the
servants of Christ, revealing truth, inspiring faith, and
making their words the power of God unto salvation.
They prayed in the Spirit; they spake in the Spirit;
they lived in the Spirit. The promise of Jesus was fulfilled:
&ldquo;Lo! I am with you alway&rdquo; (Matt. xxviii.&nbsp;20);
for the Christ-presence was continually revealed in them&mdash;a
revelation of Him, not, indeed, to the eye, but to the soul,
and unspeakably more blessed than had been His bodily
presence when on earth. Not the Apostle only, but every servant
of God, could say: &ldquo;I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth
in me&rdquo; (Gal. ii.&nbsp;20); and in the hour of peril, when all men
forsook him, the Christian confessor triumphantly affirmed:
&ldquo;Notwithstanding, the Lord stood with me and strengthened
me&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim. iv.&nbsp;17). In every subsequent age the
indwelling Spirit of God has been the fountain of power
in the ministry; and the mightiest men in the pulpit, renouncing
self-sufficiency, have confessed, with Paul: &ldquo;Our
sufficiency is of God, who also hath made us able ministers
of the New Testament&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. iii.&nbsp;5, 6). Conscious of
need, they have turned their souls upward to God, and
this Divine Helper has entered and filled them; and all
the faculties and culture of the man, intellectual, moral,
and spiritual, have been transfused, elevated, enlarged, by
this invisible but mighty Power. It has been truly said:
&ldquo;The virtue of an electric wire is not in the wire, but in
<span class="pagenum" id="p167">[p.&nbsp;167]</span>
its connection with the voltaic battery. The power of the
minister is not in the polish of his style, the pictorialness
of his illustrations, the fervor of his manner, the order and
arrangement of his discourse, but in his living connection
with God and his capacity to act as a connecting-link between
God and the human soul. It is God in the soul which
is the secret of true pulpit power.&rdquo;</p>

<p>How, then, shall the pastor maintain an inner life such
that he shall be &ldquo;endued with power from on high&rdquo; and
God shall speak through him to the souls of men? In
answer this I suggest as a means of chief importance:</p>

<p class="gap">I. <span class="smcap">The Habitual Practice of Secret Prayer.</span>&mdash;For
prayer is the bond which links the Divine power with the
human. It is the channel through which God pours His
life into the soul. It is the uplifted hand of man&rsquo;s weakness
taking hold on God&rsquo;s strength. It calls down from
heaven the sacred fire, which alone may kindle the preacher&rsquo;s
sacrifice. It has the most vital relations to the character
and work of a pastor.</p>

<p>1. <i>The relation of secret prayer to the spirit and purpose of
the ministry.</i></p>

<p>Special dangers beset the pastor. The most sacred services,
from their frequent recurrence, may come to be performed
in a perfunctory spirit, and his life may thus degenerate
into mere professionalism. Unconsciously he
comes to meditate, read, and even pray with a view only
to others and its effect on others. The sense of his personal
relation to God is lost. As a public speaker a desire
for popularity may unduly influence his preaching, and
conspicuous position tempt his ambition, obscuring his
vision of the great end of his ministry&mdash;the honor of
Christ and the salvation of souls. The very respect which
his office secures may foster spiritual pride and make him
insensible to his defection in heart from God. Few men
<span class="pagenum" id="p168">[p.&nbsp;168]</span>
are environed by such subtle and powerful seductions to a
false life as a Christian minister, and against these only
a vivid consciousness of his high calling is an adequate
safeguard. He is God&rsquo;s ambassador, receiving his commission
and his message, not from men, but from the Sovereign
of heaven and earth. The souls of his congregation
are entrusted to him, and the words he is charged to speak
are the words of God&rsquo;s saving power. &ldquo;In them that are
saved&rdquo; he is &ldquo;a savor of life unto life,&rdquo; but &ldquo;in them that
perish&rdquo; &ldquo;a savor of death unto death&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. ii.&nbsp;15, 16).
If faithful to his trust, he &ldquo;shall shine as the brightness
of the firmament&rdquo; and &ldquo;as the stars for ever and ever&rdquo;
(Dan. xii.&nbsp;3); if unfaithful, the blood of souls will be
found on him in the day of God&rsquo;s inquisition. Now, only
a distinct realization of these responsibilities as an ever-present,
living force pervading his spirit will hold the minister
in his inmost life true to Christ and to his work.</p>

<p>It is here prayer has its mightiest reflex power. It gives
a vital sense of God and of spiritual realities. It lifts the
life above the control of lower motives to a loftier moral
elevation, with a purer atmosphere and a broader horizon.
The whole man is elevated, ennobled, transfused with Divine
life, as he holds communion with God. When Moses
had been with God in the mount, his face shone with a
glory such that Israel could not steadfastly look on it. It
was when Jesus was praying that he was transfigured,
&ldquo;and His face did shine as the sun, and His raiment was
white as the light&rdquo; (Matt. xvii.&nbsp;2). God imprints His own
image on the soul that comes face to face with Him.</p>

<p>The inner life of a preacher always stands revealed in
the pulpit; it transfuses itself through his preaching. No
mere declamation, no arts of rhetoric, no dramatic simulation
of emotion, can conceal the absence of spiritual life.
Moral earnestness can never be assumed; it is the attribute
<span class="pagenum" id="p169">[p.&nbsp;169]</span>
only of a soul profoundly feeling the power and reality of
Divine truth. The man, therefore, who would speak God&rsquo;s
Word with the pungency and fervor of a Bunyan, a Baxter,
a Flavel, or a Payson must, like them, be constant and
fervent in prayer. The springs of spiritual life opened in
the closet will pour forth never-failing streams of life in
the pulpit. Luther said: &ldquo;Prayer, meditation, and temptation
make a minister.&rdquo; He himself is said to have spent
three hours daily in prayer, and those mighty words which
thrilled the heart of Christendom were the utterances of a
soul thus glowing with the flames of devotion.</p>

<p>2. <i>The relation of secret prayer to the apprehension of spiritual
truth.</i></p>

<p>Spiritual truth is revealed only to the spiritual mind:
&ldquo;The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit
of God;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. neither can he know them, because they
are spiritually discerned&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor. ii.&nbsp;14). Spiritual susceptibility
is the essential condition of apprehending
spiritual truth. A soul instinct with Divine life, sensitive
to Divine impressions, in sympathy with Divine things&mdash;this,
and this only, can enter in to a realization of those
great truths which constitute the Gospel. Without this the
very message the pastor is charged to preach he himself
will fail to apprehend. He may, indeed, see the Christian
doctrines through the eye of an impassive logic, but such
a lifeless intellectualism, even when abstractly correct, has
no power. The theology of the pulpit is a theology vitalized
by prayer and glowing in the heart as a great, living
reality. The hearts of men are most surely moved by living
truths vividly realized in the speaker&rsquo;s soul. The love of
God in the incarnation and death of His Son, the guilt and
danger of the souls of men, the glories of the saved and
the miseries of the lost,&mdash;these are not matters of cold
intellection. To him who lives in the atmosphere of
<span class="pagenum" id="p170">[p.&nbsp;170]</span>
prayer they stand out as vivid realities. Such men, like
Paul, &ldquo;believe, and therefore speak;&rdquo; and in words of
burning fervor they utter these great truths and press
them on the souls of men. Payson, on his death-bed,
said: &ldquo;Prayer is the first thing, the second thing, the
third thing, necessary for a minister.&rdquo; Whitefield spent
hours of each day on his knees with God&rsquo;s Word open
before him, and it was from the audience-chamber of
heaven he went forth to speak those marvelous words of
power which stirred the souls of the multitude. These
eternal truths thus passed in him beyond mere intellections;
they took possession of the whole man, and he
could but speak with tender pathos and holy boldness,
as he saw light in God&rsquo;s light, and the spiritual world
was thus all ablaze with light around him.</p>

<p>Jesus Himself, the Chief Pastor, lived a life of ceaseless
prayer. Pressed under the burden of souls, he waked
while others slept. Sometimes He spent the whole night
in prayer; at others, &ldquo;rising up a great while before day,&rdquo;
He sought communion with the Father.</p>

<p class="bqpoemr">
&ldquo;Cold mountains and the midnight air<br />
&nbsp;Witnessed the fervor of His prayer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And if He, the Sinless One, the God-man, must needs
thus pray, if prayer was essential even to His inner life
and to His power in the work assigned Him, how much
great necessity must press on His weak, sinful servants!
If communion with God filled so large a place in the life
of the Chief Pastor, it surely should not have less place
in the life of the under-shepherds.</p>

<p class="gap">II. <span class="smcap">The Habitual Self-Application and Self-Appropriation
of Divine Truth.</span>&mdash;The habit of viewing
truth objectively in its relation to other truths or
to other souls, rather than subjectively in its relation
<span class="pagenum" id="p171">[p.&nbsp;171]</span>
to one&rsquo;s own soul, is one of the greatest dangers of the
minister, because his work tends directly to keep uppermost
in his thinking the needs of others. He may thus
come to conceive vividly and to present strongly the
most affecting and stupendous truths of the Gospel without
the least thought of their relation to himself and
their bearing on his own life and destiny. Nor is he in
this necessarily insincere. He has an actual and strong
conception of the truth and of its pregnancy with weal
or woe to others, and in pressing it he is true to his
present conviction; but his conception of it is purely in
its relation to others, and secures no application to his
own spiritual wants. Now, God&rsquo;s only way, so far as we
know, of saving and sanctifying an intelligent soul is
through the truth; and this not truth conceived in the
intellect as a mere object of thought, but truth conceived
in the heart, entering into the center of a man&rsquo;s being,
and acting as a life-force in his deepest moral convictions
and affections. &ldquo;Born again by the Word of God, which
liveth and abideth for ever&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Pet. i.&nbsp;23), &ldquo;Sanctify them
through Thy truth, Thy Word is truth&rdquo; (John xvii.&nbsp;17),
are passages which indicate an unvarying law of the Gospel.
All spiritual life comes from the Holy Spirit, acting
through Divine truth received into the soul. To this law
God has not made the minister an exception. The measure
of religious life in him, as in every man, is determined by
the extent of this believing appropriation of Divine truth
and its consequent living power in him. He may be, therefore,
a learned theologian, holding in his intellectual vision
a wide range of truth, while yet, from failure in heart appropriation
of it, he is a dwarf in vital spiritual development,
because Christian life grows not from mere knowledge,
but from truth believingly appropriated.</p>

<p>The pastor, therefore, should cultivate the habit of applying
<span class="pagenum" id="p172">[p.&nbsp;172]</span>
and appropriating to his own soul the truths he
preaches. He should habitually look at them in their
relation to himself and take them into his own life by
a distinct act of faith, which believingly, joyfully, appropriates
them as belonging to him. Every truth thus
received will become in him an added element of life,
deepening and enlarging his religious consciousness and
imparting a richer and more blessed experience. Then,
from this fountain of life within, thus ever enlarged and
enriched, he will present in the pulpit, not a dead system
of doctrines, but a living Gospel which shall come with
fulness of life to the people.</p>

<p class="gap">III. <span class="smcap">An Habitual Self-Surrender and Consecration
to Christ and His Work.</span>&mdash;Selfishness, in its more insidious
forms, endangers the life of a pastor. Outwardly, by office,
he is consecrated to the service of Christ, and for this very
reason he is less likely to detect, deep down at the springs
of his living, the presence and power of a self-love, in the
form of pride, envy, self-will, self-indulgence, and ambition,
which may be, after all, the controlling force in his inner life.
The danger is here the greater because, its growth having
been unperceived, the man is unconscious of its control,
and because, with all &ldquo;the deceitfulness of sin,&rdquo; it lurks
stealthily, but all the more potentially, within the sacred
forms and associations of a consecrated office. Hence the
necessity of frequent and rigid self-examination. A man
must interrogate himself, and with careful introspection
seek to detect the real forces that control his life. There
should be pauses in his career when he will stand alone
in the presence-chamber of the Omniscient One, and cry,
&ldquo;Search me, O God, and know my heart; try me, and
know my thoughts; and see if there be any wicked way
in me, and lead me in the way everlasting&rdquo; (Ps. cxxxix.&nbsp;23, 24).
The best lives have found great value in such
<span class="pagenum" id="p173">[p.&nbsp;173]</span>
special seasons privately set apart for fasting, prayer, and
self-examination, as the navigator, in the perils of his
voyage, stops to take observation of the sun and stars and
make certain what is his position and whither the winds
and currents are bearing him. Then, with vision thus
clarified, and in full view of his real position, he should
make a distinct renewal of self-dedication to God, giving
up himself, with all he is and has, unreservedly to Him.</p>

<p>Without this self-renunciation and self-devotion to Christ,
as an habitual fact, the inner life will be without spiritual
power. Jesus, in His promise of the Holy Spirit and of
the Christ-presence, makes this the one, essential condition:
&ldquo;If ye love Me, keep My commandments, and I will
pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter&rdquo;
(John xiv.&nbsp;15, 16). A true consecration of self to Christ,
therefore, assures the presence of the Holy Spirit as the
revealer of Christ within the soul. This was the habitual
attitude of the apostle Paul. He says: &ldquo;The life that I
now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,
who loved me and gave Himself for me&rdquo; (Gal. ii.&nbsp;20).
Self was nothing, Christ everything; for when confronted
with peril of death, he said: &ldquo;None of these things move
me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I
might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which
I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of
the grace of God&rdquo; (Acts xx.&nbsp;24). Thus self-dedicated, he
received the promise: The Spirit wrought in him mightily,
filling him with Divine life and power. So utter was his
self-abnegation, and so all-absorbing his love of souls, that,
like Moses of old (Ex. xxxii.&nbsp;32), he &ldquo;could wish,&rdquo; were
it right and would it secure their salvation, to be himself
&ldquo;accursed from Christ&rdquo; for them (Rom. ix.&nbsp;3). With like
self-devotion to souls, Rutherford, the eminent Scotch
minister, while assuring his flock that they &ldquo;were the
<span class="pagenum" id="p174">[p.&nbsp;174]</span>
objects of his tears, care, fear, and daily prayers,&rdquo; said
&ldquo;My witness is above, that your heaven would be two
heavens to me, and the salvation of you all as two salvations
to me.&rdquo; A ministry thus self-forgetting is of necessity
a ministry of power; for God Himself works in it, as all
history has shown.</p>

<p class="gap">IV. <span class="smcap">An Habitual looking Above for the Reward.</span>&mdash;&ldquo;Godliness&rdquo;
has &ldquo;promise of the life that now is&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Tim.
iv.&nbsp;8); and nowhere, perhaps, is that promise more fully
realized than in the pastorate in the present age. In
social relations, in opportunities for culture, in friendships
formed, in means of influence, in popular estimation,
and even in temporal support, few positions in life
have higher advantages or more agreeable surroundings.
But, with all this, life, even in a faithful ministry, is, on
its earthly side, rarely other than a disappointment; and
the pastor who seeks reward in human applause or in
any form of earthly hope, not only thereby excludes the
Holy Spirit from his life but is also sure to find unrest
and failure as the ultimate result. The rewards of the
faithful pastor are from God and are of special magnitude
and blessedness.</p>

<p>The rewards come, in part, in the present life. A
faithful minister finds them alike in a clear conscience
and a sense of the approval of God, and in his work
itself and the blessed results following it. With all its
care and toil, the ministry, to the man who knows his call
of God to the work and devotes himself to it without
reserve, is the happiest work on earth. &ldquo;Sorrowful&rdquo; he
is, &ldquo;yet always rejoicing.&rdquo; Henry Martyn said: &ldquo;I do
not wish for any heaven on earth besides that of preaching
the precious Gospel of Jesus Christ to immortal souls.
I wish for no service but the service of God in laboring
for souls on earth and to do His will in heaven.&rdquo; Dr.
<span class="pagenum" id="p175">[p.&nbsp;175]</span>
Doddridge: &ldquo;I esteem the ministry the most desirable
employment on earth, and find that delight in it, and
those advantages from it, which I think hardly any other
employment on earth could give me.&rdquo; Rutherford:
&ldquo;There is nothing out of heaven, next to Christ, dearer
to me than my ministry.&rdquo; Brown: &ldquo;Now, after forty
years&rsquo; preaching of Christ, I think I would rather beg my
bread all the laboring-days of the week for an opportunity
of publishing the Gospel on the Lord&rsquo;s Day than
without such privilege to enjoy the richest possessions
on earth.&rdquo; Such is the testimony of godly ministers in
all ages, even in periods of bitter persecution. The conscious
presence of Christ; the blessed privilege of declaring
to guilty men God&rsquo;s rich and free mercy; the
delight in the work of saving souls and of ministering
comfort and strength and hope to the sorrowing, the
weak, and the despairing; the joy of communion with
saints,&mdash;all these enter into the minister&rsquo;s experience,
and give to his work even on earth an unspeakably rich
reward.</p>

<p>But the highest reward of the ministry is reserved in
heaven. There they will &ldquo;shine as the brightness of the
firmament&rdquo; &ldquo;and as the stars for ever and ever&rdquo; (Dan.
xii.&nbsp;3). &ldquo;He that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth
fruit unto life eternal&rdquo; (John iv.&nbsp;36). Every soul won
to Christ here will there be an occasion of eternal joy.
Paul said: &ldquo;What is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?
Are not even <i>ye</i> in the presence of our Lord Jesus
Christ at His coming?&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Thess. ii.&nbsp;19). Glorious beyond
our thought is the reward set before every faithful Christian:
he shall receive a &ldquo;crown of righteousness&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim.
iv.&nbsp;8), a &ldquo;crown of life&rdquo; (James i.&nbsp;12), &ldquo;an eternal weight
of glory&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Cor. iv.&nbsp;17) and shall &ldquo;shine forth as the
sun in the kingdom of God&rdquo; (Matt. xiii.&nbsp;43); and all
<span class="pagenum" id="p176">[p.&nbsp;176]</span>
this intensified shall be the reward of the true pastor,
according as he is faithful to his high calling from God.</p>

<p>Let the pastor, then, seek most of all to be faithful to
Christ and His work. Let it be to him &ldquo;a very small
thing&rdquo; that he &ldquo;be judged&rdquo; &ldquo;of man&rsquo;s judgment&rdquo; (1&nbsp;Cor.
iv.&nbsp;4) and let him ever cherish as of chief moment a
clear conscience, finding his highest comfort in the sweet
assurance of God&rsquo;s approval. Be it his to have &ldquo;respect
unto the recompense of the reward,&rdquo; and so endure &ldquo;as
seeing him who is invisible&rdquo; (Heb. xi.&nbsp;26, 27). Thus, will
his life approximate that grandest of merely human lives&mdash;the
life of him who declared, &ldquo;As we were allowed of
God to be put in trust with the Gospel, even so we speak,
not as pleasing men, but God which trieth our hearts&rdquo;
(1&nbsp;Thess. ii.&nbsp;4), and at the close of which it was said, &ldquo;I
have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I
have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me
a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous
Judge, shall give me at that day&rdquo; (2&nbsp;Tim. iv.&nbsp;7, 8).</p>

<p>When of old, at the Sea of Galilee, the Lord reinstated
Peter after his fall, He thrice with solemn emphasis proposed
the question, &ldquo;Simon, son of Jonas, <span class="smcap">lovest</span> thou
<span class="smcap">me?</span>&rdquo; He thus taught for all the ages that personal love
to Him is the primal condition for the sacred office. Without
this as the central, fontal principle in the soul the
pastor&rsquo;s life will fail of spiritual power, but with this as
its impulsive force he will be like the faithful minister
seen by Bunyan&rsquo;s pilgrim: he &ldquo;had eyes lifted up to
heaven, the best of books in his hand, the law of truth
was written upon his lips, the world was behind his back;
he stood as if he pleaded with men, and a crown of gold
did hang over his head.&rdquo;</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
